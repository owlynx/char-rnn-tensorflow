There's just one place for me near you it's like heaven to be near you
Times when we're apart I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray more than just two lips away
If my time could be spent near you I'd be more than content near you
Make my life worthwhile by telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you

Times when we're apart...
