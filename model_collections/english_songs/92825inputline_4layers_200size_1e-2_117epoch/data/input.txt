As a child you would wait
And watch from far away.
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play.

In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change,
But it was just a dream!

Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Will come
When you'll have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself,
Your spirit never dies!

Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Maybe I'm broken
Maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should have
Only the good die old
That's what they told me
But I don't know, whoa

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep
To the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to
Drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold
And crumble away

Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason
Breaking me down to my knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light, oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep
To the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to
Drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold
And crumble away

I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you

I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you

I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my

About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder stopped in cold to read
No time
Get mine and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry

No lies and no deceiving, that is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that death is from above
No time
I get by and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a

A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry

Life isn't always what you think it'd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll
Make it up to you somehow, somehow

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word dream maker, life taker

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
Disappear dream maker, life taker

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

I want to believe

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

First comes the blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real
Who can you trust?
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

Statues and empires are all at your hands,
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turnin' stale and its cold,
Oh you'll no longer fear when your heart's turned to gold
Who can you trust
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

I'm dying to feel again,
Oh anything at all,
But oh I feel nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' at all

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done

Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a
Way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do
You wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
Used to show
In the moonlight
Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
Used to show
In the moonlight
Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness for you to come around

Oh these days oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades but you remain
Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you
I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it then I can atone

Oh these days oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades but you remain
Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Forgive me
Forgive me

Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

Goodnight

Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks but not to me
'Cause heaven knows that nothing good comes free
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down

But I'll take your word
'Cause after all you've never lied
Oh not at all
But look at me
Oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down

To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
Thats nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper
Then I see its a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

There was a little old lady, who was walkin' down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah  that's city life

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Ooh

Friday night last orders at the pub,
Get in the car and drive to the club,
There's a massive crowd outside so we get in to the queue
It's quarter past 11 now we won't get in till quarter to.

It's quarter to and we get to the front,
Girl on a guest list dressed like a cunt
She asked security to check in my shoes,
You can play this game with me but you know you're gonna lose.

Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me cos you'll get reaction,
Another drink and I'm ready for action,
I don't know who you think you are,
But making people scared wont get you very far.

Ooh
Ooh

In the club make our way to the bar,
Good dancing love but you should of worn a bra.
Guy on the mike and he's making too much noise,
There's these girls in the corner wanting attention from the boys.

I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd,
Don't understand why they're being really loud.
They make their way over to me,
They try to push me out the way,
I'll push her back, she looks at me and says,
What you tryna say?

Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned


Ooh
Ooh

Oh, oh deary me
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
I don't understand how one could watch so much TV
Oh, my baby brother Alfie, how I wish that you could see.

I only say it cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Now, now, there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
My dear mon frere.

Oh Alfie, get up it's a brand new day
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
Get off your lazy ass, Alfie
Please use your brain
Surely there's some walls out there that you could go and spray
I'm feeling guiltier for leading you astray
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll ever get laid,
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

I only say it cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Now, now, there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
My dear mon frere.

Oh, little brother, please refrain from doing that
I'm trying to help you out, so can you stop being a twat
It's time that you and I sit down and have a little chat
And look me in the eyes take off that stupid fitted cap

I only say it cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Now, now, there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
My dear mon frere.

A picture paints a thousand words,
As one door closes, another door opens,
And two wrongs don't make a right
Now good things come to those who wait,
Take the highs with the lows dear,
You'll get what your given and everything's gonna be alright.

What the fuck do you know?
Just cos you're old you think your wise,
But who the hell are you though,
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut,
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do you think I care?

[Chorus]
Say what you say,
Do what you do
Feel what you feel,
As long as it's real.
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real.

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself.
This horsey also told me,
I should keep my friends close but my enemies closer,
So as to protect myself.

What the fuck do you know?
Just cos you're old you think your wise,
But who the hell are you though,
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut,
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do u think care?

[Chorus]

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah





Alright so this is a song about anyone, it could be anyone.
You're just doing your own thing and some one comes out the blue,
They're like,
"Alright"
But he's saying,
"Yeah can I take your digits?"
And you're like, "No not in a million years, you're nasty
Please leave me alone."

Cut to the pub on a lads night out,
Man at the bar 'cause it was his shout,
Clocks this bird and she looks ok,
She caught him looking and she walks his way,
"Alright darlin, you gonna buy us a drink then?"
"Err no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend..."

She's got no taste hand on his waste, tries to pull away but her lips on his face,
"If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer"
"Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture."

You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think about the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"why?"
"'cause I've lost my phone".

"Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm, I'm pregnant, I'm having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah..."

I recognise this guys way of thinking,
As he walks over her face starts sinking,
She's like,
"oh here we go.."
It's a routine check that she already knows, she's thinking they're all the same.

"Yeah, you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?"
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag, tries to get away from the guy on a blag,
Can't find a light,
"Here, use mine"
"You see the thing is I just don't have the time."

You can't knock em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"'cause I've lost my phone".

Go away now, let me go,
Are you stupid? Or just a little slow?
"Please f*** off"
Go away now I've made myself clear,
I don't think so,
Nah it's not gonna happen,
Not in a million years,

You can't knock em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"'Cause I've lost my phone".

You can't knock em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"'cause I've lost my phone".

"Aw, No, I gotta go, my house is on fire.",
"I've, I've got herpes, no syphalis. Aids aids, I've got aids.",
"Yeah, I forgot my Vagisil".

Do you think
Everything
Everyone
Is goin' mental
It seems to me
It's spiraling
Out of control
Well dont you think
This time is yours
This time is mine
Its temperamental

It seems to me
We're on all fours
Crawling on your knees someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ Almighty
Do i feel alright?
No not slightly
I wanna get a flat and no i can't afford it
Its just those bureacrats that wont give me a mortgage
Its very funny cause I got your fucking money
and I'm never gonna get it just of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose it's just the way the cookie crumbles

Oh yes I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

Well do you want
Something else
Something new
Than what we got here
Well do you feel
Its all the same
Some sick game
Its so insincere

I wish i could
Change the ways
Of the world
Make it a nice place
Until that day
I guess we stay
Doin' what we do, screwin' who we screw

Why can't i sleep at night
Gonna say its gonna be alright
I wanna be able to east spaghetti bolognese
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days

All the magazines they talk about weight loss
If i buy those jeans
I can look like Kate Moss
I know its not the life that i chose
But i guess thats just the way that things go

Now listen I think you and me have come to the end of our time,
What d'you want some kind of reaction?
Well OK that's fine,
Alright how would it make you feel if I said you that you never ever made me cum?
In the year and a half that we spent together,
Yeah I never really had much fun.

All those times that I said I was sober,
Well I'm afraid I lied,
I'd be lying next to you, you next to me,
All the time I was high as a kite.
I could see it in your face when you break it to me gentle,
Yeah you really must think your great,
Let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks,
When I work my way through your mates.

[Chorus]
I never wanted it to end up this way,
You've only got yourself to blame,
I'm gonna tell the world your rubbish in bed now
And that your small in the game.

I saw you thought this was gonna be easy,
Well your out of luck.
Yeah lets rewind, let's turn back time to when you couldn't get it up,
You know what it shoulda ended there,
That's when I shoulda shown you the door.
As is that weren't enough to deal with,
You became premature.

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental,
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me,
I'm gonna reciprocate.

[Chorus]

Your not big your not clever,
No you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever.

Your not big your not clever,
No you not a big brother
Not big what so ever.

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental,
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me,
I'm gonna reciprocate.

[Chorus]

Friday night last orders at the pub,
Get in the car and drive to the club,
There's a massive crowd outside so we get in to the queue
It's quarter past 11 now we won't get in till quarter to.

It's quarter to and we get to the front,
Girl on a guest list dressed like a cass
She asked security to check in my shoes,
You can play this game with me but you know you?re gonna lose.

[Bridge]
Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned,

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me cos you'll get reaction,
Another drink and I'm ready for action,
I don't know who you think you are,
But making people scared wont get you very far.

In the club make our way to the bar,
Good dancing love but you should of worn a bra.
Guy on the mike and he's making too much noise,
There's these girls in the corner wanting attention from the boys.

I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd,
Don't understand why they're being really loud.
They make their way over to me,
They try to push me out the way,
I'll push her back, she looks at me and says,
What you tryin' to say?

[Bridge]





I've been thinking that you've crossed the line,
If you disagree well that will be just fine,
Cause you waste my time and waste my money
And your not too cool and your not so funny!
Spreading your seed all over the town
Getting too greedy and messing around
Oh my gosh you must be joking me
If you think that you'll be poking me.

[Chorus]
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know,
Don't try to deny cause my fuse is ready to blow
Its your turn to learn I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame for you

Please don't come around and knock on my door
Cause I don't want to have to pick you up of the floor,
When you ask if we can still be lovers,
I'll have to introduce my brothers,
Think that they could teach you a lesson or two,
By the time they've finished you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby,
A sea of tears they'll call the navy in.





I don't want us to have a fight
But in the background
I can hear you chatting shit
I hear it every night
And you think you're being really cool
And you've been doing it
Since we were both at school
Now who looks like a fool

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've know it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

[Chorus]
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

What happened to the good old days?
I was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
Who are you anyway?
I know you've heard this all before
I know some people who are calling you a whore
Don't know you anymore

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've know it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

When you first left me
I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What'd you do that for? (what'd you do that for?)

When you first left me
I didn't know what to say
I'd never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack
No, it don't mean jack

I couldn't stop laughing
No, I just couldn't help myself
See, you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you cant have me number,
"why?"
Because I've lost my phone.

Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm pregnant,
having a baby in like 6 months so no, and yeah, yeah

"I recognise this guy..."
That's what she's thinking,
As he comes over her heart starts sinking,
She's like,
"oh here we go"
It's a routine check that she already knows,
she's thinking they're all the same.

"yeah you alright baby?
You look alright still, yeah what's your name?"
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag,
tries to get away from the guy on a blag, can't find a light,

Go away now, let me go,
Are you stupid? Or just a little slow?

Nah it's not gonna happen,
Not in a a million years,

Can't knock em out, can't walk away,

Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you cant have me number,

Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you cant have me number,
"why?"
Because I've lost my phone.

Nah I've gotta go cos my house is on fire,
I've got herpes, err no I've got syphilis

Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper
Then I see its a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

There was a little old lady, who was walkin' down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah  that's city life

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Do you think everything
Everyone is goin' mental?
It seems to me, it's spiraling
Out of control and it's inevitable

Well, don't you think
This time is yours
This time is mine?
It's temperamental

It seems to me
We're on all fours
Crawling on your knees
Someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel alright?
No, not slightly
I wanna get a flat

And no I can't afford it
It's just those bureaucrats
That won't give me a mortgage
It's very funny 'cause
I got your fucking money
And I'm never gonna get it
Just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well, I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose it's just the way
The cookie crumbles

Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

Well, do you want
Something else
Something newer
Than what we got here?
Well, do you feel

It's your turn to learn but I think that you know where to go
It's a shame shame shame for you

Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissin'
And I remember when you started callin' me your miss's
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too.

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if for only one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

Drinkin' tea in bed
Watching dvd's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
No one in the world who could replace you

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if for only one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

A picture paints a thousand words,
As one door closes, another one opens,
And two wrongs don't make a right
Now good things come to those who wait,
Take the highs with the lows dear,
You'll get what your given and everything's gonna be alright

What the fuck do you know?
Just cos you're old you think your wise,
But who the hell are you though,
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut,
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do you think I care?

Say what you say,
Do what you do
Feel what you feel,
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself
This horsey also told me,
I should keep my friends close but my enemies closer,

Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real

Ah

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

What happened to the good old days?
I was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
Who are you anyway?

I know you've heard this all before
I know some people who are calling you a whore
Don't know you anymore

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know
And some secrets weren't meant to be told
I found the cure to growing older

I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends

Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up

Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up

Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lip
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself

They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I left

Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up

Sat outside my front window
This story's going somewhere
He's well hung and I am hanging on
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started"
So let's get this party started

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imaginations much worse
I just never want to know
And what meant the world had folded
Like legs and fingers holding on to
A better kiss that never lasts

You said between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone
Dead and gone yeah

The calm before the storm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
A reception less than warm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight

This is me standing in the arch of the door
Hating that look that's on your face
That says there's another fool like me
There's one born every minute
There's one born every minute

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imaginations much worse
I just never want to know (never want to know)
What meant the world imploded
Inflated then demoted all my
Oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance

You said between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone
Dead and gone yeah

Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off)
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)

The calm before the storm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight

Sun burnt out tonight
The sun burnt out tonight

I dried my eyes, now I crust them with sleep
I'll crust them over
She begged me "don't hate me"
She spun me a story
Where winning looks like losing
And I win every time
So thread spools sweetie, get ready
Until my silk is sold

I've dried my eyes, now its "Rushmore"
I'm deep with futures like Chicago
Glenview never meant a thing to me
She never meant a thing to me
Except for putting idealists in a body bag
Forget it
I'll go out tonight to piss on her doorstep
And listen to the misfits "where eagles dare" to swallow whole

Up

Go

Whoa, oh,I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah,I guess I'm on my own
Yeah,I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I guess I'm on my own

I served out my detention
And in the end I got an honorable mention
In the movie of my life, starring you
Instead of me
When the moonlight, hits your bright eyes I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid
Like I'll never leave your side
Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
I burnt out
My defensive
Now everything I say is taken as offensive

Walking out on the show was walking out on you
And walking out on you was the best thing that I ever did.

Last night I saw my world explode.
Well, I'm looking out at you obscured by the stand up arcade
And the sound of the descendants.
Your smile reminds me of switchblades and infidelity.

Last night I saw my world explode.

Walking off that stage tonight
I know what you're thinking
"He stands alone because he's high on himself"
But if you only knew..

I was terrified and would you mind if I
sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend
and I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

The only girl who ever gave me the time
was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine
Knocking boots in the back,
How degrading is that?
I decline

I'm too terrified and would you mind if I
sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend
and I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no, no

This might just be a waste of time
there's no one I'd rather waste
My time with than all my best friends
So start the car up

We'll all take turns not for the worst
We're all "has-beens" and "never-were's"
And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne"
Just watching life pass us by
Pass us by

As if we cared
Enough to try to catch up
Enough to make up for lost time
Enough to make up for lost time, yeah

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

She's shallow like the shoreline during low tide
But my hopes are not quite as high
Can't spot her faults but she spotted mine
She left me for herself
Considering I would too
Go figure, I'm bigger than that
The battles only halfway done
I might look young
But I'm no less defeated
How's the weather up there?
Good God I wish I was tall

Last night I saw a movie
And I thought about many movies I've seen at your house
Excuse me if I'm rude
But I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without you
Leaning on my shoulder
Distracting me from the plot line

Where can I go when I want you around
But I' can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people
Looking glossed just like a summer ago

Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

"Call me back" I'm pleading with a cork in my head
It wouldn't be the first time
My pillow has been mistaken

Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

Can't stand to be around you
Around you, around you
Can't stand to be around you
Can't stand, I can't stand
To be around you
Around you

Laughed off my affections
While I passed by your direction
Should have known from your walk, yeah
It was the end of you

It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Quick with lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes it's times like this, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a big mouth
And maybe you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole foundation
Parker Lewis can't lose

Taking back every step towards you
Still failing at everything I do
In the meantime just talking with my shoes
Converse with my Converse
At least they hear a word I say
And scrutinize it
Just as far as they can tell what I'm getting at
Tied my tongue around my neck
For the last time

It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Quick with lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes, it's times like this yeah

[Chorus]

This is the last song about you
This is the last song that I waste on you

This might just be a waste of time
there's no one I'd rather waste
My time with than all my best friends
So start the car up

We'll all take turns not for the worst
We're all "hasbeens" and "never-were's"
And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne"
Just watching life pass us by
Pass us by

As if we cared
Enough to try to catch up
Enough to make up for lost time
Enough to make up for lost time, yeah

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

Light that smoke for giving up on me
And one just cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations
"I could have died with you"
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle I confess
Now ash yourself out on the insides, when I said I loved you I swear I lied

Let's play this game called "when you catch fire"
I wouldn't piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
Wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home
Joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks great next to his teeth

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
But we never stood a chance
And I'm not sure if it matters

If you are the shores
I am the waves begging for big moons
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no

Your secret's out

I know this hurts, it was meant to
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over, you don't, don't matter

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
But it must be said again
That all us boys are just screaming

Into microphones for attention
Because we're just so bored
We never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts

Your secret's out

I know this hurts, it was meant to
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over, you don't, don't matter

I used to obsess over living
Now I only obsess over you
Tell me you'd like boys like me better
In the dark lying in on top of you

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters

I know this hurts, it was meant to
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over, you don't, don't, don't, don't matter

From day one I talked about getting out
But not forgetting about how all my worst fears are letting out
He said, "Why put a new address on the same old loneliness?"
When breathing just passes the time
Until we all just get old and die

Now talking's just a waste of breath
And living's just a waste of death
And why put a new address on the same old loneliness?
And this is you and me and me and you
Until we've got nothing left

Landing on a runway in Chicago and I'm grounding all my dreams of ever really seeing California, because I know what's in between is something sensual in such non-conventional ways.

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say.
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away.
Tonight is all about "We miss you."

And I can't forget your style or your cynicism,
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen to everything we said.
My smile's an open wound without you...and my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back.

These friends are, new friends are golden.

You only hold me up like this
'Cause you don't know who I really am
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you
We're making out inside crashed cars
We're sleeping through all our memories
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive (now I only waste my time dreaming of you)

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
All of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same

I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you
I'm not trying
You only hold me up like this

My heart is on my sleeve
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness
That means I believed
Every single lie you said

Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little tap on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck
Out in front of your neighbor's house

She took me down and said
"Boys like you are overrated. So save your breath"
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads.

You want apologies, girl you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever
The only thing you'll get
Is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever

With every breath I wish your body
Will be broken again

Bury me standing under your window with the cinder block in hand
Yeah cause no one will ever feel like this again
And if I could move I'm sure it would only be to crawl back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block...they were gone by the time we (talked)

I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details I don't want to know a thing

I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun. Remind me which side you should be on.

I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel.

My heart ticks in beat with
These kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know
Where we came from and where we call home

Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, we love you back

They'll say it's not worth
So we'll leave this town in ruins
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know
These busted lips we take back home

Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these time will never fade

How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well, I'd hope that since we're here anyway
We could end up saying
Things we always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)

How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)

I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
I know you're wondering when

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like deja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight

Singing Amen, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
And I'm singing

Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive
Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing Amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

This time, this place misused, mistakes
Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted, I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed, I need to hear you say
That I love you, I've loved you all along
And I forgive you, for being away for far too long
So keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and
Never let me go, keep breathing
Keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and
Never let me go, keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

Ouh, and now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test

I like the white stains on your dress
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)

And I love your lack of self respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

Ouh and I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

Ouh and now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it
Ooh

Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you, come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings
I'm fallin' and all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And, oh, I scream for you come, please
I'm callin' and all I need from you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Hurry, I'm fallin'

And all I need is you
Come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin'
I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Hurry, I'm fallin'

Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

I'm through with standin' in lines to clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub
Big enough for ten plus me
(Yeah, so what you need?)

I need a a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher
And James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves
To blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writin' all my songs
Lipsync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

Well it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything that we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooooohhhhhhh

We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, the tequila just hit me
Ooooohhhhh
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown

We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
To get anything that we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooooohhhhhhh

Ticking like a time bomb, drinking till the nights gone
Well get you hands out of this glass, last call my ass
Weeelllll no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
To get anything that we want
To drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooooohhhhhhh
We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
To get anything that we want
To drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without
A sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet

Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and
I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with him must have
Damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet

Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet

Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet, no, no

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time I had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must of done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of lookin' out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They said somebody went and burnt it down

We use to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I

[Chorus]

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me

Wake up, my baby still look amazing with no make-up
Damn it I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers say, I wanna meet your mother
Your daddy, your sister and your brother

One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
But darling my shit moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Said it's only twenty karats it can't be that hard to find it baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

Light on Sunset, can't imagine the two ain't having fun yet
Baby maybe just wait 'cause I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I looked over man
Way to sugar coated you were busy motorboatin'
On that blonde girl
Keep up with what you're doing
Ain't nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another come along girl
If you ain't afraid to try it
You know we'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you wanna you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

She's got me runnin' round and round

Flo Rida girl, you got me runnin' round hey
What a perfect misses, my misses still eat McDonalds
Taste delicious prim madonna knock this swiss so I guess she did it
What my kisses, what my pictures
Steppin' the oo back pay a visit
To my baby yeah my baby girl
Run around town on a treadmill
I ain't going nowhere, no underwear
That's what she wear
Gotta playmate wanna join the party
She was supposed to be like Hugh Hef
Birthday cake wanna grant my wishes
Every day I'm losing my breath
Can't replace that face, that waist
I chase this girl, a barefoot dare, baby

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you wanna you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

I miss you
So, so, I do
I miss you
So, so, I do
I miss you
So

I just woke up from a dream today
Time gone by but you still look the same
Felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you
That I

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
(I miss you, so, so, I do) so, so, I do
I miss you
So, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do

After dark, laughin' in the rain
Silver heart locket on a chain
Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do

If there was some way, you know I would
I'd do it today, I wish I could
I call out your name, it does no good
I wish I knew what would

I, I miss you so much
God knows I do, I
I wish my wish was enough
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so

Where will you be when the sky comes down?
And what would you do if the strength was found?
Stand right beside me when the ground starts shaking
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Once it's started, there's no turning back
And I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
When you're standing in the heart of darkness
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Holding on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home

Holding on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light come on

Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We find the light come on

This is the calm before the coming storm
If we can find the light
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We find the light come on

I know it's late but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warning
And I'm tired of ignoring all the space that's between you and I
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite.

Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite.

Do you recall how long it must have been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means.
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite.

Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite.

Dance around the moon,
You and I every night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

I cant believe that days took into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay
Inside this atmosphere

Dance around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

Dance with me around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite

Before this hits the ground,
Before this fades away,
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around,
Before I walk away,
I want you to make me
Make me
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again
Believe again

If you could take the dirt
And wash it all away
If you could say the words
That make me want to stay
Just tell me there's a chance
To Hell with all the blame.
If you could take my hand,
If you could lead the way,
I want you to make me,
Make me,
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

She's got me nervous
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour
She's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, what's wrong with right here on the counter?

Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola roller-coaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.

So good I never wanna waste it
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybody's faces

Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola roller-coaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.

What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)
What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

Slow it down, make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
Cause its to much, yeah its a lot
To be something I'm not

I'm a fool, out of love
'Cause I just can't get enough

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down
I know, I've got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

The sun is hot in the sky
Just like a giant spot light
The people follow the signs
And synchronize in time

It's a joke, no body knows
They've got a ticket to that show
Yeah

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down
I know, I've got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

Just enjoy the show

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down
I know, I've got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

Just enjoy the show
Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back

Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back

Just enjoy the show

I won't let this burden bring me down.

So here we are again
Starin' at the end
Of what we made and who we are.
Never knowin' when
One of us will break apart
And walk the other way, love.
I don't know what to say, love.
I don't know how to stay
When you won't let me be
The person that I am.

The writings on the wall.
There?s nothin' to say anymore.
So ill leave before I fall apart
Right back into your arms.
The writings on the wall.
You gave nothin' back at all.
But I want something better.
I won't let this burden bring me down.

What are we to do?
What are we to say to one another
Now were through?
Thanks for bein' you.
Thanks for bein' all things
I had to say goodbye to.
I'm over bein' lied to.
I'm over bein' pushed into the person
That you want me to become.

The writings on the wall.
There?s nothin' to say anymore.
So ill leave before I fall apart
Right back into your arms.
The writings on the wall.
You gave nothin' back at all.
But I want something better.
I won't let this burden bring me down.

Oh where did it go wrong?
We had it for so long.
But now there's no point in turning back
Let's face the fact

The writings on the wall.
There?s nothin' to say anymore.
So ill leave before I fall apart
Right back into your arms.
The writings on the wall.
You gave nothin' back at all.
But I want something better.
I won't let this burden bring me down.

I won't let this burden bring me down.

Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to

But if I should break, if I should fall away
What am I to do?
I need someone to take, a little of the weight
Or ill fall through

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

Take a little time, walk a little line
Got the balance right
Give a little love, gimme just enough
So that I can hang on tight

We will be alright, I'll be by your side
I wont let you down
But I gotta know, no matter how things go
That you will be around

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

Don't let me fall

Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

You'll be the one that I'll love forever more
I'll be here holding you high above it all
But don't let me fall

I will never be, I will never be tall, no
And I will never be, never ever be sure of it all
Oh, why is the world so cruel to me
When all, all I ever want to be is anything I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

I will never be, I will never be you, no
I will always be, I will always be me, that I know
But oh, even though I'm happy being me
I want to get away from all this harsh reality, oh

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

Anything I'm not
Oh, anything I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

A second, a minute, and hour, a day goes by.
I'm hopin' just to be by your side.
I'm turnin' the handle
It won't open.
Don't make me wait, cause right now I need your smile.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

Knockin'

A warm bath, a good laugh, an old song that you know by heart.
I've tried it but they all leave me cold.
So now I'm here waiting to see you,
My remedy for all that's been hurting me.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

You seem to know the way
To turn my frown upside down
You always know what to say
To make me feel like everything?s ok.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

Knockin'
Nothin' works like you, oh oh
Knockin'

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

It's difficult to see from the surface.
But everything goes in and it stings,
Like a spider.
Hits you deep inside and

I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
Well I ordinarily breathe.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.

All these words that we speak casually.
Well maybe I'm just weak, but it hurts me.
Well it cuts, like a knife
It hurts me deep inside and

I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
Well I ordinarily breathe.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.

I should put on my armor the next time I see you
So I won't be harmed. I know I can shoot my own arrows.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I know that like me you can be oversensitive.

I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
Well I ordinarily breathe.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.

Yeah it's dangerous and sweet.
Don't you know it's dangerous and it's sweet?
Cut us and we bleed.

Trouble will find you no mater where you go, oh oh
No Matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow, oh oh
The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn, oh oh
Your fine for a while but then start to loose control

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. oh oh

Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe, oh oh
And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow, oh oh
He sees what I see and he knows what I know, oh oh
So don't forget as you ease on down the road


So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win, but I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh

Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave, I try
Oh Oh I try

One of these days you'll be
Under the covers you'll be
Under the table and you'll realize
All of your days are numbered
All of them one to one hundred
All of them millions
All of them trillions
So what are you gonna do with them all?
You can not trade them in for mall
No no

Take every moment, you know that you own them
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you

Give me a reason
To fight the feeling
That there's nothing here for me
Cause none of its easy
I know it wasn't meant to be
I know it's all up to me, I know it's all up to me
So what am I gonna do with my time?

I'll take every moment, I know that I own them
It's all up to you to do whatever you choose

Live like you're dying and never stop trying
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you

All of the moments you didn't notice
Gone in the blink of an eye
All of the feelings you couldn't feel
No matter how you try

So tired of feeling blue.
Such a heavy weight on you.
So shake it off and make your way
Oh no now you're leaving me
Oh what will you do all alone
In the big bad world?
I'm not worried, no.

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna skip along,
Quite merrily, baby.
You're gonna ravel in hate.
And what's goin' on?
And you're like a sugar ball
And oh how you could
No I will come and you'll
Just skip along.

Were so oblivious.
Comes natural to us.
Keep smiling knowing all the while

[Chorus]

Wouldn't it be lovely to be home? oh
Safe and sound and no one left
To bring us down but so far away.


No I will come if we just skip along.

[Chorus]
I can't forget you when you're gone
Your like a song
That goes around in my head
And how I regret
It's been so long
Oh what went wrong
Could it be something I said
Time, make it go faster
Or just rewind
To back when I'm wrapped in your arms

All afternoon long
It's with me
The same song
You left a light on
Inside me
My love

I can remember
The way that it felt
To be holding on to you

[Chorus]

Time
Make it go faster
Or just decide
To come back to my happy heart.

You and me will be lying side by side
Forever forever
Underneath this adolescent sky
Together together
And you will hold my heart inside your hand
And You'll be the one, the one to tell me

[Chorus]
Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
To get there
We'll get there
But oh, if there's one thing that we know
It's that we will not grow old

You made me swear that our hearts will never die
No never, no never
Cause no one seems to believe that we can fly
Forget them, forget them
Oh, you told me

[Chorus]

Oh, how could we know that day, it came with age
That oh, the feeling would fade

[Chorus]

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

Woke my weary head
Crawled out of my bed
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"
Nothing's going right, shadow's took the light
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving love to find a way
Through this messy life I made for myself
Heaven knows I need a little

Hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

I gave my hope to you
When you were early through
And you said, "Oh, I can't go on
Well, now I need it back
'Cause I have got a lack of all that's good
And I can't go on

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Everything's okay, everything's okay
Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Roll, roll with the punches
Roll, roll with the punches

That really hurt me
Like a fist to the face
I wasn't ready
To be knocked out of place
Suddenly everything I was sure of
Sinking below the depths of the surface
It's unexpected, it usually is
When you're rejected
Or you take a hit
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

Little weapons over the phone
They like to threaten the life that I know
They say get over here and get into the ring
But I'm not really much a fighter
My mechanisms of defense are down
My resistance is out on the town
I was alarmed by your attack
This isn't a boxing match
But I'll be damned if I ever let you win

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

When all I want is a little stability
Some time without any bruises
You go and tell me the things that I don't want to hear
Putting your fist into my ears
Filling me up with the dread and the fear leaving you all in pieces
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to hold, hold, hold your head up high
When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

Woke my weary head
Crawled out of my bed
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"
Nothing's going right, shadow's took the light
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving love to find a way
Through this messy life I made for myself
Heaven knows I need a little

Hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

I gave my hope to you
When you were early through
And you said, "Oh, I can't go on
Well, now I need it back
'Cause I have got a lack of all that's good
And I can't go on

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Everything's okay, everything's okay
Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Just when you think that it will never get you
It comes and throws a lightning bolt right at you
Before you know it now your pulse starts racing
And now your blood is running hot like crazy

Oh, give it everything, everything that you've got

No, I never knew that I could feel this way
No, I never had it running through my veins
No, I never thought that it could be enough
Suddenly you, you shock me into love

It's waiting for you right around the corner
It doesn't have the decency to warn ya
It comes along and taps you on the shoulder
You fall the arms that now will hold ha

Oh, give it everything, everything that you've got

No, I never knew that I could feel this way
No, I never had it running through my veins
No, I never thought that it could be enough
Suddenly you, you shock me into love

Electricity shoots from you to me

As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox
As fast as a hare, as brave as a bear
As free as a bird, as neat as a word
As quiet as a mouse, as big as a house

All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
All I wanna be is everything

As mean as a wolf, as sharp as a tooth
As deep as a bite, as dark as the night
As sweet as a song, as right as a wrong
As long as a road, as ugly as a toad

As pretty as a picture hanging from a fixture
Strong like a family, strong as I wanna be
Bright as day, as light as play
As hard as nails, as grand as a whale

All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
All I wanna be is everything

As warm as the, the sun, as silly as fun
As cool as a tree, as scary as the sea
As hot as fire, cold as ice
Sweet as sugar and everything nice

As old as time, as straight as a line
As royal as a queen, as buzzed as a bee
Stealth as a tiger, smooth as a glider
Pure as a melody, pure as I wanna be

All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
All I wanna be is everything at once

She moved in to the house next door
Said she'd never been in love before
Tried the best she could to hide herself away

But every time she turned the lights down low
He thought he heard a voice calling out so slow
Come and take me away from all this pain
And he said

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart

You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Every morning when she came outside
He tried to be the one to catch her eye
But she would only turn away and hide

He started to concoct a plan
To get her to return the feelings that he had
To show her how he thought they were entwined

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart

You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Little love letters written in red
Folded up, put away next to the bed, oh
Little crushed hopes every day
Waiting in the wings to spirit her away

I don't know anymore
I don't know what I've been fighting for
But something inside me won't go quietly

And I could be anywhere
'Cause we're all breathing the same air
It goes inside and makes me feels alive
And all I can say is, all I can say

I am here and I will be
Following my own way
Forever and a day
I am here and I'm here to stay

Oh, we are here and we will be
Following our own way
No matter what you say
We are here and we're here to stay
We are here to stay

No matter where you roam
Anywhere you lay your heart's your home
Stand your ground if they push you down
Because all you can say is, all you can say

We are here and we will be
Following our own way
No matter what you say
We are here and we're here to stay

We are real and we feel it
When you deny us
Or when you get tired of us
We are here and we're here to stay
We are here to stay

I never knew when enough was enough
Or whether to stay when the going was tough
But I won't let a little heart be afraid
And all I can say is, all I can say

I am here and I will be
Following my own way
Forever and a day
I am here and I'm here to stay

Oh, we are here and we will be
Following our own way
No matter what you say
We are here and we're here to stay
We are here to stay

Little crushed hopes every day
Waiting in the wings to spirit her away

Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real; don't give me fake
Give me strength; reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time; give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one, 'cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength; reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me all your politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

But give me love over, love over, love over this, ahhh
And give me love over, love over, love over this, ahhh

Where do we go nobody knows?
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've gotta say...
I wasted all your time, honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face
Yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down... when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
Ah yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down...when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face

Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, oh, sing one we know
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say oh
I say oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, yeah, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are, you are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
It...

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realized
Who cannot live without
Ooh and come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

That green eyes
Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Since I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes
Green eyes
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Honey you are the rock
Upon which I stand

A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
I miss you so
And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

Oooooooo

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms

A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Who remembers your face
Who remembers you when you are gone

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me
Look for me when I am lost
And just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper

(Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper)
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Who remembers your face
Who remembers you when you are gone

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me
Look for me when I am lost
And I am just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Oh ha ah ah ah ah ah ah

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and I missed em
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Woahhh ohhh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that

You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Woahh ohhh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces
A tide of the human race
So, an answer now is what I need...

I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon
Oh come on love stay with me...

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
Is on your side, It's on your side now
Not pushing you down, and all around
No it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose

You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose

Stuck in a corner
are monkeys in cages
that don't have a number
to fight one another

Try to recover

Climb up the ladder
look up and you see birds
blind as each other
how long can we suffer?

We're as blind as each other

On the cloud that you're sitting
there's one born every minute
so much to discover
I've become a believer

Sisters and brothers
who fight one another
will mourn and deceive us
will find us and keep us

Take us or leave us

How soon is now? yeah
how long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
with something together

Come on and stick together

On the cloud that you're sitting
there's one born every minute
so much to discover
I've become a believer

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Get's colder day by day, I miss her

I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Get's colder day by day, I miss you

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown

Oh all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
Cause here
Everybody here's got somebody to lean on

I awake to find no peace of mind
I said how do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear
I said, what do I know
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
But the spies hide out in every corner
You can't touch them no, 'cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, which way do I turn
Oh I forget everything I learn

But the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
The spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

And if we all hide here
They're going to find us
If we don't hide now
They're going to catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're going to find us

And spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
Though spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you no
'Cause they're just spies
They're just spies

Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, oh, sing one we know
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say oh
I say oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, yeah, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh

Oh no I see
A spider web it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I said
Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I've done

And oh I never meant to cause you trouble
And oh and I never meant to do you wrong
And oh well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

Singing out
Oh I never meant to cause you trouble
Oh I never meant to do you wrong
Oh well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
X4

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure

Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

When I'm counting up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulder
I drove the other ones away

If you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
Everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

Cause if you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost

But you pay me no attention, do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you

And on and on from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you can

Did she want me to change
Well I change for good
And I want you to know
But you always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver, shiver, shiver

I'll always be waiting for you
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you

And is this is my final chance of getting you

And on and on from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep

Just you try and stop me

Just to see if you care

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Did she want me to change

And I'll always be waiting for you

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh and it's the part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I'll lose myself tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight

I woke up with the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I'll lose myself tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight (Whoo)
Lose myself tonight

So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I go to civil rights rallies
And i put down the old d.a.r.
I love harry and sidney and sammy
I hope every colored boy becomes a star
But don't talk about revolution
That's going a little bit too far
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I cheered when humphrey was chosen
My faith in the system restored
I'm glad the commies were thrown out
Of the a.f.l. c.i.o. board
I love puerto ricans and negros
As long as they don't move next door
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

The people of old mississippi
Should all hang their heads in shame
I can't understand how their minds work
What's the matter don't they watch les crain?

I hope the cops take down your name
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I read new republic and nation
I've learned to take every view
You know, i've memorized lerner and golden
I feel like i'm almost a jew
But when it comes to times like korea
There's no one more red, white and blue
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I vote for the democtratic party
They want the u.n. to be strong
I go to all the pete seeger concerts
He sure gets me singing those songs
I'll send all the money you ask for
But don't ask me to come on along
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

Once i was young and impulsive
I wore every conceivable pin
Even went to the socialist meetings
Learned all the old union hymns

I am just an innocent Bastard
What can you expect from me?
My energy is empty
My batteries run low
Life leads into a hopeless situation
Leaves me with a broken motivation
I can't try harder
No one who fights more than me

I don't want to try no more
I don't really want to cry no more
This time I quit
No place for me to fit
I don't want to give no more
I don't really want to live no more
This world is sick
Welcome to the Silent Republic

I know we share this feeling
I know the pain you hide
You're sick of your senseless being
Attracted to suicide
Agonized by the fools who don't care
We will break from the truth of despair
No one tries harder
No one who fights more than us

We don't want to try no more
We don't really want to cry no more
This time we quit
No place for us to fit
We don't want to give no more
We don't really want to live no more
You think we're sick?
We are the silent Republic

Fly nigga couldn't tell me nothing different homes
And I be good til the fat woman sing a note
I'm tryna find life's meaning up in this Patron
I'm taking women to heaven and then I take em home
I'm waking up with something twenty something fly shit
Wanna stunt shit, all that new designer shit
Word, she said she love me but she lying
Shit I'm lying too! Told that bitch I love her for her mind
Well that's quite true, bust-a-move, head game lover boo
Bust that pussy open, turn that sofa to a fuckin pool
I'm playing Cody, smoking stogies, make the rhythm better
I'm looking good in everything, but she look good in leather
Call me cocky I love it, baby father a sucker
I'm longer than em I ain't talking no Rockin Republic
I don't shop in the public, ain't finna wait in line
This not a free throw, this easy as a lay-up line

If I got time, you got time too
You with a boss, baby, so when I move you move
Let's have some drinks, Malibu and how I do
And after that we do whatever we want to
Girl I'm in charge, that means I'm coolin
I'm on my own agenda, that means I'm coolin
Baby I'm large, that means I'm coolin
Dealin with a winner, that mean I'm coolin

Pimp-stroll on em, the pen cold on em
Couldn't fuck with it with a million nymphos on ya
Bitches tend to love a nigga with the most money
I tell em "honey, I know Cher, I'm so sunny"
And this is all pro-bono
All-Star weekend floor seats by the coaches
Flying all frequent, reclining on beaches
Half a millie on the road, y'all relyin on features
I ain't married, but I'm tryna find a keeper
If she cook and keep her vagina like a secret
And we fuck, I beast up and throw a little peace up
So peace out, I'mma get up with you in like three months
Word, absence will make the heart grow
With that said, I ain't around like my old combs
And I be drinking all the brown straight, no Coke
I'm chasing money, not the liquor, y'all ain't even close
So let's have a toast, everything fine
This ain't a free throw, this easy as a lay-up line

If I got time, you got time too
You with a boss, baby, so when I move you move
Let's have some drinks, Malibu and how I do
And after that we do whatever we want to
Girl I'm in charge, that means I'm coolin
I'm on my own agenda, that means I'm coolin
Baby I'm large, that means I'm coolin
Dealin with a winner, that mean I'm coolin

[Intro - J-Kwon - talking]
Ay world, this Streets 101
I'm fin' to give you a half a pound of J-Kwon
And a quarter bird of TrackBoy music

[Hook - J-Kwon]
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse - J-Kwon]
This the new improved Hood Hop
I make erry mu'fucker in this bitch do the whop
Derty run his mouth 'til the album drop (why's that?)
TrackBoy beat like a freak, work a king on the block
I'm seventeen, name ain't same on the block
And beat and knock the nigga out his frame on the block
And he'll come through and let rang on the block
And all they got to say is it's a shame on the block
I'm hot HOMEBOY! don't ever get it twisted
Number's unlisted, stayed in 3rd district
For real, I'm ready to get naughty
Best of both worlds so, hey shawty!
Show me the party, and I'll show you the coke
I can show you my dick, you can show me your throat
If a nigga trip-trip then we'll show him the fo'
If his niggaz run up to you, we'll show him so mo'

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Now I wish a nigga would run up like that
When I put that on the hood, I'ma strike back
And niggaz talk shit, but I don't like that
Sayin' I don't like G, but I ain't write that
And baby mamas mad they ain't 'bout shit
Basically what I'm sayin dude, fuck a bitch
And if I had two, I'd touch a bitch
In the same breath turn around and touch her clit
And nigga if I said then I fuckin' meant it
And nigga if it's rented I ain't fuckin' in it
TrackBoyz give me money so I fuckin' spend it
y'all roll Sprewells but not the authentics
And fuck ya-fuck ya fo' and ya roof clown
I got shit that'll turn ya fuckin' Coupe 'round (*gun cocking*)
You ain't heard? I'm the truth now
Matter fact, hook gon' break it down
Break it down

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Dogg it's a mystery..
How we drop one single, left the game now the whole world miss me
Freak this bitch like homegirl Missy
Like I'm sellin' liqour, got the whole world "Tipsy"
Sick and tired of old g's tryin' to gip me
So I put a lump in his shit, like a hickey
All I say is to them, "Dude come get me"
Watch 'em catch a crude desire, like a gypsy
Funny how I can't loc in public
Smoke in public, girl even joke in public
Got dough, so that's why I'm so republic
Cops hit the do', I start actin' so republic
I had a set, they actin' like I had a brick or more
So you got snitched on by the carni-whore
Show-Off or show ass what these guns are for
Or let the priest show her mom what these nuns are for

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[21 second instrumental to open]

[Z-Ro]
If somebody got a problem with me, come and address it
If the shoe fits it then walk in it I'm talkin to Texas
See I'm from a section where we kid each other for practice
So I keep grenades and a chopper right under my mattress
Please don't let the gold and the diamonds fool you
I promise it's nothin for your family to lose you
It's just when you speak to me watch ya tone, call the chief on the phone
Bring the beef to your home, make you sleep under some stones
Z-Ro the Crooked, but you faggots already know my name mayne
Know you'd love to catch me slippin in the turnin lane mayne
Fuck a rap tuck my strap right in back of my britches
I'm just rappin to pay my lawyer for creatin a witness
I done smoked somebody befo' and smokin's a bad habit
They say it always take you to your casket, but fuck death
Cause I ain't scared, bitch I'm ready to fly
But until I go I'ma murk niggaz and get my fetti right now

I'm a soldier, these stankers keep me reachin for my holster
Sometime I feel my death is creepin closer
But I'ma keep on thuggin like I'm 'posed ta, 'posed ta

[Z-Ro]
Look at the conditions I was livin in, I didn't have a clear vision then
I needed ends cause there was no residence for me to sleep in
Nigga the streets raised me, man they played me sometime
But a real nigga regroup relax and take this back on his grind
I was gifted with a sick grip game, and it stick to the spoon
Plus I'm gifted at spittin make my vocals click to a tune
Bitch I'm schizophrenic, I probably won't stick to this mood
Hope I don't lose it 'fore I have to bring this brick to this dude
I heard some niggaz got somethin to say 'bout me back in the hood
Can't be Mo City, cause everyday I'll be back in the hood
And we can scrap or we can take it to the straps in the hood
You get your stuff or be murdered and won't be back in the hood
Same way I stack the republic I'm just like that in the hood
Bring to you a hat in public or a hat in the hood
Niggaz say Rap-A-Lot ain't payin me like I ain't got nuttin
If six figures is bein bent over, I'm lovin the fuckin

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
All you niggaz that talk down, just might get walked down
Become another statistic and down these war grounds
Nigga pull up your hands, just look at each other
But guaranteed to beat up a bitch he gon' wanna make me suffer
So I shoot first, look at his head burst, bleedin
And exit to dig a ditch that's even, give me the reason
Promise I've been lookin to get some stress off
I let the muh'fuckin mac-11 hack everything under the neck off
Used to be a problem child now I'm a problem grown up
I done done some evil shit and one day I'ma have to own up
But when I say somethin homey I mean what I say
I'ma murder you straight up or I can lean when I spray
Z-Ro the "fuck everybody" nigga from Screwed Up Click
Now I ain't gon' let you bend over to tie your shoes up bitch
I'ma launch a Bernard Hopkins type of blow in your jaw
That's the way I police my perimeter, Ro is the law

[Chorus]

The requested track is not viewable.

I'm older but you're wiser than anyone can see
Your patient like no other has even been with me
Your eyes take me to places
I'd never dreamt about
Your voice is the only music I can't do without

There can't be any doubts now
We're just too far ahead to look behind
And above the good and bad

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

Your hands that have no mercy
Are also my best friends
And I can get lost climbing on your legs that never end
I found a perfect distance between my body on you
And that is no distance, dear if that's alright with you
They said we wouldn't make it
But look at how we've beating all the odds
I just need you to be aware of that

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

I just want you to take a leap of faith
No it's easy to make all the same mistakes
But I won't this time, no, not this time

I need you to believe in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

A dozen icy summers were leading me to you
I had to hear the liars to recognize the truth
Remember the first Christmas
It almost seemed untrue
You promised that you'd always be with me
And I promised too

Boy meets a girl
Hid behind a wall
Piling up the bricks
Hoping they would fall

Girl meets a boy
Surrenders to his charms
Leaves her old boyfriend and crumbles in his arms

And if they wanna make me pay now
Then go on
Cause loving you was never wrong

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

Lazy for a while
Laying golden eggs
Some just want your money or whatever they can take

But hearing your name
Don't need anyone else
You're here because you want me
And not for what I make

Hey, they better know
If there is a price to pay now, the game is on
Cause in the end you know I won

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

And every camera flash my way
And every word of every page
Well they can say whatever they want to
Cause what we got is just so real
That they can't feel the way I feel
Cause I would do it all again for you

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

Every morning when I woke up
I was choked up
I was leaving without a purpose
Always jumping all the hurdles
Doing circles in the dark with a broken compass

I can't explain the way it feels
I could trip on my own words
I make mistakes, that's much is clear
But I made it here my love
Yeah I made it here my love

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if mess up everything someday
I would hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

One thing I got right
One thing I got right

Every morning when you wake up
I wanna hold you
I just need to be wrapped around you
It's kinda funny when you think that you just got here
Now I know I can't live without you

I can't explain the way it feels
I could choke my own words
Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
Like you're really here my love, yeah, you're really here my love

You're the one thing that I got right
It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if mess up everything someday
I would hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

Every time I see your smile
Every time I hear your laugh
Baby you bring in new sunshine over now
You are the little dream
Ever since I was a child
My fairytale comes true when I look at your face
May not be here forever
But it'll be a long road together
I already know
We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

You're the one thing that I got right
And if mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
You're the one thing that I got right

One thing I got right
One thing I got right

La la la la la

I dare you!

All of my life, to late
To you showed out with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you

Of all the millions, on the planet
You're the one is keeping me on it
You know I like you, and nobody's business
And your are my witness
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
I dare you to touch me
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
I dare you

I found your t-shirt
And I stripped your bed
I left you perfect
But there's no appreciation

I listened sweetly to your sour tone
I loved you only
But there's no reciprocation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left
In my heart, in my soul

Should have never helped
You become so powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
But you just don't care about me

You say you're thirsty
So I pour the wine
The bottle's empty
But there's no consummation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left
In my heart, in my soul

Should have never helped
You become so powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
But you just don't care about me

Oh, baby, how we used to dance
I couldn't separate from your hands
Now they don't even play that song anymore
You don't care about me

No, don't care about me
No, don't care about me
You don't care about me, no
Don't care about about me, no

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
But you just don't care about me

Take off all of your skin
And brave when you are free
Shake off all of your sins
And give them to me
Close up, let me back yea
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
Wooo wooo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo

I will follow you down wherever you go
I, I'm, baby, I'm bound to you and do you know?
Closer, pull me in tight
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
Woo woo
We are alive
Woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
We are alive
Woo

I'm just gonna raise my head
Welcome to the final edge
And I'm gonna fall
I'm just gonna raise my head
And hold you close

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
Woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo

And I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat
Yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do
When it comes to you
I see only the good
Selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah
You gotta hold on me, I never met someone so different

Oh here we go
You're a part of me now
You're a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

I can't remember to forget you

I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say
Is not to forget
You see only the good
Selective memory

The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
Do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
Do anything for that boy

I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
Do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
Do anything for that boy

Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

And I feel again losing my mind
Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Keeps me and my arguments come under
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I always throw the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
No you won't see me popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

You're my medicine

Why do you say things
If you do not mean them
Why do you fill up my wounds
With your dirt

Bullets of fire
This time I can't shield them
Santa Maria, I know how it hurts

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

Why do you make me believe we are spirits
Mourning together to conquer this Earth (Mourning together)
Climb up the mountains
So high we can see them
Then send me to plummet with savaging words

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

I am covered in scars
Like a rose without thorns
My defenses are gone
No one's out there to warn
If there's love in your heart
Let me leave now in peace
You know you took it too far

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so, so, so
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so

The requested track is not viewable.

The requested track is not viewable.

You can be my alphabet
And I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator

I will time you as you run up to down
And you will measure my footsteps as I pleasure this town
The mean of our heights is divided by the
Nights
Which is timed by the daggers in the root of all our fights

The pass of your poem is to sway me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

I am a dash and you are a dot, when will you see that I am all that you've got?

I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago, but to you I'm just a novel that you wish you never wrote

I'm greater than x, and lesser than y

So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?

You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I'm sitting here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one
And if I'm four words then I am needing of your love.

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia
Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia

When I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I look around me
And feel you are ever so close to me
Each tear that flows from my eye
Brings back memories of you to me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You were all, you alone and no one else
You were meant for me

When morning comes again
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by
Until finally my time descends on me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

Come along it is the break of day
Surely now, you'll have some things to say
It's not the time for telling tales on me

So come along, it wont be long
'Til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies
In this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

Well it's been rough but we'll be just fine
Work it out yeah we'll survive
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate

So come along, it wont be long
'Til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies
In this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of work
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

I'm being dragged down, down by the hand
The hand of a golden giant man
He's crushing my knuckles
Splitting my skin, he says he will
If only I'd ask it of him

He says
Girl, it's your call
You wanna fly
You wanna fall
So I shout
I wanna get away from you
As fast as I can
I tell my feet to move it
I hope they have a plan

[Chorus]
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today

So now I'm free
Free
From the big bad giant

Who was stalking me
Thank you feet, for guiding me
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least

[Chorus]

Sometimes I'm tempted
Sometimes I am
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man
He was the line between pleasure and pain
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim

[Chorus]

You were waiting for me, adore me, you saw me
As I wish the whole world could
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could
You would lick the tears from my eyes when I cry
How I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you deceive you I needed you
I believed in you.

So I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my eye
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart

All I have are pictures and stitches and riches
But money could never buy what you give
Though my heart is achin' and breakin' I'm takin'
Most of what you send my way
I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told
I am coming back for you
I know we will be okay everyday
The sun shines a little brighter

So I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my eye
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my eye
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I'm trying not to fall apart

When in the night we'll set a light
I'm wishing with all of my mind
Oh no, I never meant to let you down
Never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I never let you down
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart.

Pick me up in your arms
Carry me away from harm
You're never gonna put me down
I know you're just one good man
You'll tire before we see land
You're never gonna put me down

Oh I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day you're not day too soon

Honey I will stitch you
Darling I will fit you in my heart
Honey I will meet you
Darling I will keep you in my heart

You'll risk all this for just a kiss
I promise I will not resist
Promise you wont hold me down
And when we reach a good place
Let's be sure to leave no trace
Promise they wont track us down

Now I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah, I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon

Honey I will stitch you
Darling i will fit you in my heart
Honey I will meet you
Darling I will keep you in my heart

I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon

Oh honey I will stitch you
Darling I will fit you in my heart
Honey I will meet you
Darling I will keep you in my heart

You shot me up, yeah
You filled my cup, oh
You sailed my boat
You were my last hope
You took my very last hope away

Oh you, you will be loved by someone good
And you, you will be loved by somebody good
You have been loved

You dropped the bomb
And now you're gone
I held you dear
You swallowed my fears
And now I've drunk my last beer with you

Oh you, you have been loved by someone good
Yeah you, you will be loved
Oh will you ever know
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago
Only sadness remains
And it will pass

Yeah you you will be loved by somebody good
By somebody good

I've stuck around, through thick and through thin
You cannot deny, I've always been in
But I've watched you stand, still as a snowman
But I don't see you change, you're always at meltdown

Yeah I've been your crutch, your smell sight and touch
Yeah I took you home when you've drunk too much
But I can't survive, with you by my side
See I'll never get laid, while I'm running your life

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate

So just cut me loose, learn to tie your shoes
There's somebody here, I'd like to introduce
So look in the mirror, look for the glass
?Cause you're not my problem, you are my last

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
I'm just a girl that you lost to cocaine

Come with me to a place of fantasy

Death by chocolate is myth
This I know because I lived
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl
This is only right now

Death by crying doesn't exist, though
The headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode
But you reach the end of the road
And you, little tree
I'm certain you will grow

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend

Death by anger this is true
Just let him go he can't hurt you
Oh little girl this is such a cruel cruel world
This is the first, of a million broken hearts

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend

Oh it won't be long you will grow strong
Up up and away

He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf

Someone plugged you in
And sadly they clipped your wings
Now you can't fly away electric bird
Yeah someone took your tweet
One day they fed you that bad seed
You can't fly away electric bird

Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic


Got to set you free, you were blinded by deceit
You can't fly away electric bird
So now this rooms all staged
While you're stuck there in that cage
You can't fly away electric bird

Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic

Beautiful calm driving, deep sea pearl diving
Constantly unwinding, beautiful calm driving
You turned into another
You turned into nutter
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger
To me

Beautiful calm driving, emotional hiding
Effortlessly shining, beautiful calm driving


You turned into another
You turned into nutter
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
Beautiful calm driving

Send a wish upon a star
Do the work and you'll go far
Send a wish upon a star
Make a map and there you are

Send a hope upon a wave
A dying wish before the grave
Send a hope upon a wave
For all this souls you failed to save

And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well

Send a question in the wind
It's hard to know where to begin
So send the question in the wind
And give an answer to a friend

Place your past into a book
Put in everything you ever took
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook

And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well

Repeat chorus

Send a wish upon a star
Send a wish upon a star

You got me pushing imaginary buttons
Step away from me lover, away from me lover
You got me counting imaginary school children
Get away from me lover, away from me lover

Stealing hearts was your pastime
I saw girls falling hook line
You stole kisses and threw them aside
Hits and misses your love-side

You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better

Making waves was your hobby
And I asked you to hold me
And I knew it
You do it in front of the world
And I'll end up different from the other girls

You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better

I'm in here, can anybody see me?
Can anybody help?

I'm in here, a prisoner of history,
Can anybody help?

Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for,
You to come rescue me,
I need you to hold,
All of the sadness I can not,
Living inside of me.

I'm in here, I'm trying to tell you something,
Can anybody help?

Stuck inside these walls,
Tell me there is hope for me
Is anybody out there listening?

Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for,
You to come rescue me,
I need you to hold,
All of the sadness I can not,
Living inside of me.

It's dangerous
To fall in love, but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us
We're bristling with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire
Burn me

So come on, I'll take you on, take you on, I
Ache for love, ache for us, why
Don't you come, don't you come a little closer

Wanna put my hands through you
I'll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath
Loving you to death, loving you to death

The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassin's delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when it's time for you to die

Detonate me

Decapitate me
Hit me like a baseball
Emancipate me
Free the animal, free the animal

And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
I might have thought that we were one
Why not fight this war without weapons?
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
And let's be clear, I trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Put on my best dress, I wanted to impress
I put a little make-up on
Put a bow in my hair, wore pretty underwear
Hoping you might take it off
Don't know your etiquette
But I'm strapped to my chair
And it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming, until
You saw your chance to kill
Your chance to make history

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

You wonder why you make girls cry

Resistance is low, gonna blow a fuse

Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey Satan, paid my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land

I'm on the highway to hell
(Don't stop me)

And I'm going down, all the way down
I'm on the highway to hell

Loose lips sink ships
So come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide, so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I

I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Cruisin' on the seven seas
A pirate of my loving needs
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]
So let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it right up
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

Loose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So screw 'em off and plug 'em in
Then switch it on and start all over again

I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Ticking like a time bomb
Blowing up the fuse box
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]

Outta my way I'm a running high
Take a chance with me and give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world I know
'Cause I ain't lookin' for an overflow

Oh baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off your high heels and let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there

I'm wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) baby
I'm wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
I'm glad you got to see it all
We're rising, falling, like at sea
Your lookin' so good under me

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) to you
I'm gonna walk all over
You

Moanin' groanin' stereo
Said gimme the stage I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be the night

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over
You

I'm gonna walk all over you

Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive

Baby I got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you being so unkind?
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone?

Thoughts of you goin' through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You said that you loved me too
But tell me who was there with you

I was talking birds and you was talking bees
And was he down on his knees
Beatin' 'round the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You eaten your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you

You can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush, oh

Chew it up, spit it out
Let it all hang out,
Beating around the bush

(Yow! One, two)
Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hand off me
And give me plenty of
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, baby what's the going price?
She told me to go to hell

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no

Said, baby, you're driving me crazy
Laid it out on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy she's mine
Oh!

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame, yea yeah
To be shot down in flames

Hey you Angus, shoot me, shoot
That's nice, woo! Uh! Oh! Oh! Wooooh!

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Oh
Shot

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

I don't want the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Ohhh

I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she's got

She's stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walkin' down the street

Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
Enough to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She gives me first degree
She really satisfies me

Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War

You know I'm losin' sleep
I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

You know she moves like sin
And when she lets me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)

You know she really got the rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (rock n roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

It's criminal
There ought to be a law
Criminal
There ought to be a whole lot more
You get nothin' for nothin'
Tell me who can you trust
We got what you want
And you got the lust
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the streets
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
Yes you have

It's animal
Livin' in the human zoo
Animal
The shit that they toss to you
Feelin' like a christian
Locked in a cage
Thrown to the lions
On the second page
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the street
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
O positive

Blood on the rocks
Blood on the streets
Blood in the sky
Blood on the sheets
If you want blood
You got it

I want you to bleed for me

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive

Baby I got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you being so unkind?
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone?

Beating around the bush, oh

Chew it up, spit it out
Let it all hang out,
Beating around the bush

It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder and lightening start

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much, touch me

Seems like a touch, touch too much
You know it's much too much, much too much
I really want to feel your touch too much
Girl you know you're giving me much too much
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much too much too much

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Giving me a touch, a touch too much
Baby gotta a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much

A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch
Come on touch me
Ah

Gonna have ourselves a party

And no one's playing hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll

My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're gonna die

If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing as I split the night
Cause if good's on the left,
Then I'm stickin' to the right

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight

Love came (love came, love came) forever

You're a nurturer and a superwoman
You're every daughter that becomes a mother
And you can be my rock to the highest mountain top
From my heart to my toes, to cherish, love and hold

You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen

You're a counsellor, just like grandmas do
You're that voice, you're that push for all I dream and do
So I cherish you, like royalty
And by all means, I'll never put my hands on thee

'Cause you're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen (You gave birth)
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
You're my queen

I never want her be rid me
The merest sensitivity
See you're a grown, strong women
And I'm never gonna call you out your name
Yeah man make this and man make that
'Till the end of time, it's a well-known fact
Behind the greatest man is a virtue of a woman

You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen

You could be my daughter

My virtue of a woman
My rock, half guiding light
(You're my queen, queen, queen, queen, queen)
You're the backbone of every man, baby
I won't never, ever call you out your name baby
You're my queen, you're my call
You're my love, you're my all
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen

Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Why don't you mean it ?
Why do I follow you and where do you go
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun - begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
March to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa
A voice from behind me reminds me
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

Aah ah aah
La la la la laa
Ah ah ah ah aah
Ah la la la laa
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began

I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah





Mary queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin'
The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming
Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving
No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising

Well, I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing

The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order
But I was not born to live to die, and you were not born for queenin'
It's not to late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'

Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'
But on your bed, Mary, I can see the shadow of a noose
I don't understand how you can hold me so tight and love me so damn loose

But I know a place where we can go, Mary
Where I can get a good job and start out all over again clean
I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen





We took your body
Turned to ash
Down by the waterside
We watched the reason your dust collides

I watched the old man cry from the otherside
No, no it won't help you
No, no it won't

Lost inside a day that never happened
To feel this way again year after year
In the back of your mind
I'll find you, I'll find you-uu
In the back of your mind

Everyone holds on to someone they loved
That's how the trouble starts
That's when it falls apart
Tell me this is not the end
Of everything I've ever known
Everything I've ever known

No, no it won't help you
No, no it won't help you

Lost inside a day that never happened
To feel this way again year after year
In the back of your mind
I'll find you, I'll find you-uu
In the back of your mind

Lost inside a day that never happened
To feel this way again year after year
In the back of my mind
I'll find you
In the back of my mind





Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Why don't you mean it ?
Why do I follow you and where do you go
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun - begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
March to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa
A voice from behind me reminds me
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

Aah ah aah
La la la la laa
Ah ah ah ah aah
Ah la la la laa
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah





You never heard my song before the music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well for now we both know how
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...

Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
A misty castle awaits for you
And you shall be a Queen (you shall be a Queen)
Today the cloud, it hangs over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...

When I was you and you were me and we were very young
Together took us nearly there, the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
But some day one day...
We'll come home





Oh
Tonight I'm gonna show
Them what I'm made up for
The killer queen inside me's
Coming out
Say, "Hello!"

Oh
Tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you I'd watch them all be burnt
Whoa-Oh, Whoa-Oh

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

I can be
The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be
The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
Our dream is happening
I can be the queen

I
Wind and hurricane
The stormy sky and rain
When you run dry I'll flood your pain
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

In between the moments of
The lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rhomp-a-bump-a

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

I can be
The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be
The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
Our dream is happening
I can be the queen

The quee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-een
The que-ee-een
Quee-ee-een
Quee-ee-een

Starry night come inside me like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door
I will fly on a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

He's a fairy feller
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new moon's shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke

Plow man wagoner will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly dally oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
He's a dirty fellow
What a dirty laddie-oh

Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero ah
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow (can we see the master stroke)
What a queer fellow

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Soldier sailor tinker tailor plow boy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch magician presides
He is the leader

Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a queer fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on mister feller
Crack it open of you please

This is a song about a card game
Black queen, holding hearts
Black queen, tear the game apart
Black queen, don't you know?
Can't beat aces all in a row, black queen, no you can't
Have mercy black queen

Don't you go mess with the black queen, no
Black queen, see the whole hand
Black queen, where's your black man?
Black queen, if he ain't in the hole
Black queen, you got some more to show me, black queen
Oh, get on me black queen

Oh, Lord, have mercy, black queen
She's called to beat me clean
Black queen, where's your bank roll?
Black queen, where did it go?
Black queen, the truth is hard
Black queen, you're playin' foolish cards, black queen

I have sinned dear father, father I have sinned
Try and help me father
Won't you let me in ? Liar
Oh nobody believes me - Liar
Ooh, why don't you leave me alone ?
Sire I have stolen, stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should
Liar - oh everybody deceives me
Liar - ooh, why don't you leave me alone ?

Liar - I have sailed the seas
Liar - from Mars to Mercury
Liar - I have drunk the wine
Liar - Time after time
Liar - You're lying to me
Liar - You're lying to me
Father please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me in the right way
Liar liar liar liar
Liar that's what they keep calling me
Liar liar liar

Ooh, let me go

Listen, are you gonna listen ?
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
Mama I'm gonna try behave
All day long
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
I'm gonna serve you till your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna keep you till your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
All day long and pray
All day long and pray
All day long and pray
All day long, wow, all day long, wow
All day long, all day long, all day long
Yes, all day long, all day long, all day long, all day long, yeah
All day long, we have lift off, ow

All day long, all day long, all day long
Liar liar they never ever let you win
Liar liar everything you do is sin
Liar nobody believes you
Liar they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
So now you know you could be dead before they let you, aah

Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la

Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive yeah
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive - shake

Ow
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, c'mon
Keep yourself alive
Mm, you take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon c'mon keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied

Goodbye, Betsy, I'm goin' away
I'm sick of you and there ain't no way
Don't want to know, don't want to see
Don't you ever bother me

Sick of hanging around your pad
Sick of your Mom and sick of your Dad
Yes and Betsy, it's sad but true
Now I'm even sick of you

No way, no way, no way
No way for our love
No way for our love

Good bye, Betsy, I'm going away

Sick of your mom and sick of your dad
Yes and Betsy it's sad but true
Now I'm even sick of you

No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way for our love
No way for our love

Every evening and every day
Seem to always turn out this way
To get an end, I better find new love
Then you'll pay, then you'll pay, ain't no way
'Cause I'm sick of you

Goodbye, Betsy, I'm going away
I'm sick of you and I don't wanna stay
Don't want to know, don't want to see

Well, I live here in kill city, where the debris meets the sea
I live here in kill city, where the debris meets the sea
It's a playground to the rich but it's a loaded gun to me

Well, I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
But if I have to die here, first I'm gonna make some noise

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Turn that boy loose

Yeah, the scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
The scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
Until you wind up in some bathroom, overdosed and on your knees

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up

Uh
I played tag in the auto graveyard
I looked up at the radio tower
Rag tent by the railroad tracks
Concrete poured over steel bridge
Pondered my fate
While they built the interstate

I'm a product of America
From the morgue to the prisons
Cold metal, when I start my band
Cold metal, in my garbage can
Cold metal, gets in my blood
And my attitude

Yeah, a huh
Threw my hide in an automobile
Heard a song called "Drive the wheel"
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

This is the song of my heritage
From the bad to the Buddha

Cold metal, that's what it be
Cold metal, from sea to sea
Cold metal, it's how we win

And also how we sin
How we sin, how we sin, how we sin, how we sin

Cold metal, in the afternoon
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune
Cold metal, it's the father of beat
The mother of the street

Cold metal, it rolls on by
Cold metal, gonna raise it high
Cold metal, it'll even fly
Rust buckets in the sky

Cold metal, got to be
Skeleton of the free
Cold metal, it's gotta be
Better save a tree

Save a tree, save a tree, save a tree, save a tree
Yeah

Well I'm just outa school
Like I'm real real cool
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message that I gotta be
A wild one
Ooh yeah I'm a wild one

[Chorus]
Gotta break it loose
Gonna keep 'em movin' wild
Gonna keep a swingin' baby
I'm a real wild child

Gonna met all muh friends
Gonna have ourself a ball
Gonna tell my friends
Gonna tell them all
That I'm a wild one
Ooh yeah I'm a wild one

[Chorus]

I'm a real wild one
An' I like a wild fun
In a world gone crazy
Everything seems hazy
I'm a wild one
Ooh yeah I'm a wild one

[Chorus]

I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Oh baby
I'm a wild one

[Chorus]

You have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space

The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I don't know what's coming next

We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
I'm not a big man
It's hard to face the world

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
That would nail me to the wall

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth
It can't fall

Well, I live here in Kil City where the debris meets the sea
I live here in Kil City where the debris meets the sea
It's a playground for the rich but it's a loaded gun to me

Well, I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
But if I have to die here first, I'm gonna make some noise

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Turn that boy loose

Yeah, the scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
The scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
Until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
When we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild . . .

I've already been
Down the street of chance

I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says ... sh-sh-shhh

Things have been tough
Without the dumb dumb boys
I can't seem to speak
The language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
The whole world down

The first time I saw
The dumb dumb boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front
Of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed
Not at all
And we'd sing
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Dumb dumb day
Where are you now my
Dumb dumb boys are you
Alive or dead
Have you left me the last
Of the dumb dumb daze
Then the sun goes down
And the boys broke down

People said we were negative
They said we'd take but
We would never give
But we'd sing da-da-da
Da-da-da dumb dumb day
Da-da-da-da-da dumb
And hope it would pay
Da-da-da-da it's been
A dumdumdum day
A dumb dumb day

Now I'm looking for
The dumb dumb boys
Where are you now
When I need your noise

Now I'm looking for
The dumb dumb boys
The walls close in and
I need some noise

Well the day begins
You don't want to live
'Cause you can't believe
In the one you're with
'Cause you know her tricks
And you know her past
When she makes a face
You just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing.

So you turn around
Toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks
Who have got no past
Yea that's what you think
And you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed
Like a young banshee
And she wants for this
And she wants for that
What did you think.

Before you go
Do me a favor
Give me a number
Of a girl almost like you
With legs almost like you
I'm buried deep in mass production
You're not nothing new
I like to drive along the freeways
See the smokestacks belching
Breasts turn bronw
So warm and so brown

Though I try to die
You put me back on the line
Oh damn it to hell
Back on the line, hell
Back on the line
Again and again
I'm back on the line
Again and again
And I see my face here
And it's there in the mirror
And it's up in the air
And I'm down on the ground

By the way
I'm going for cigarettes
And since you've gotta go
Won't you do me that favor
Won't you give me that number
Won't you get me that girl
Yeah, she's almost like you
Yes, she's almost like you
And I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yeah, I'm almost like him

Sweet sixteen in leather boots
Body and soul, I go crazy
Baby, baby, I'm a hungry
Sweet sixteen

Funky bar all full of faces
Pretty faces, beautiful faces
Body and soul
Body and soul
I give to you
I am an easy mark with my broken heart
Sweet sixteen

Show you my explosion, sweet sixteen
Go out to the funky bar I get hurt, crying inside
'Cause everybody's so fine
And they don't need me

Tell me what can I do, sweet sixteen?
I give my body and soul sweet sixteen

I must be hungry
'Cause I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby
I know

That's not normal
But I love you
I love you
I love you
Sweet sixteen
Everywhere I go, I love it

Well, I never got my license to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yeah, some dumb, weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yes, some dumb weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head out on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Some weird sin
Some weird sin

I am a passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backside
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight

I am a passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripped-back sky
And everything looks good tonight

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
See the city's ripped backsides
We'll see the bright and hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine so bright
The sky was made for us tonight

Oh, the passenger
How-how he rides
Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the silent hollow sky
He see the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
'Cause it just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and see what's mine

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window's eye
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the city asleep at night
He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
Oh, let's ride and ride and ride and ride

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

I saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon, her
Young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight

Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love her till the end
I am gonna love her till the end
I will love her till I die
I will see her in the sky
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pain disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I labeled you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me

Couldn't be much more from the heart

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore
Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops in me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back to the room that's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

I can't remember anything

I know cause I've seen it
It was grey and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in the world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more

[Bridge]
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Take a lesson
From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can't change all our tactics
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on your own

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
This is the modern way
Faking it everyday
Taking it as they come
We're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
That this is the modern way?

I know where I'm going
I know we are in the knowing
I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want

[Bridge]





How could we not notice it before
Well you may as well have pinned it to my door
Well we are so slowly coming around to the fact
That this friend is a friend no more

And if you think you are right then you are wrong
No one ever really knew what's going on
Now we are all so slowly coming around
And this friend of a friend was no friend all along

The penny drops with the top of tory fell
To the cruel and bastard Taj Mahal
A penny more to the floor of Sacre Coeur
From the Spanish men to the Yorkshire moors

In nights of old, they lie in the roads.
Off with their heads, and always lead opinion polls.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.

In uniforms, of green and gold,
Like crocodiles they march in files of unison.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free.

I like it too much, I like it too much.
I like it too much, I like it too much.

[Chorus]
Cause you are, descended from animals, and you are constructed of chemicals.
The one thing you cant have, you lie too much.

You look but you cannot touch.


Like dominoes, one only goes. They all fall, sail the ship, rock the boat.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free.


I like it too much I like it too much.
I like you it much I like it too much.

[Chorus]

You look but you cannot touch.
I like it all too much.

[Chorus]

You look but you cannot touch. I like it all too much.

Yesterday you lay awake on your bed,
And worked out you?d done everything that you said,
That you knew therefore you'd got to be saved,
The lord of the bored and a slave to her (wage?)

[Chorus]
It's a mystery
Oh, it's a mystery
You want some history
Oh its a mystery

So last night you got up and out of this room,
The ceiling is peeling and covered in gloom,
Jaguar shoes is the best you deserve
Decision, a lesson you ought not to learn.

[Chorus]

Today as you shake off the drunken degree,
All that is left is the faint memory,
The downing,the drugs,all the nights on the tiles,
It?s hard to remember but totally worthwhile.

[Chorus]

It's a waste of money
You have to admit
And its a waste of money
You have to have it?

It's a waste of freedom
You have to resist
If you're wanting history
You've got it

It's a waste of money
You have to admit
And its a waste of money
You have to have it?

It's a waste of freedom
You have to resist
If you're wanting history
You've missed it

Don't stop moving
You mustn't stop moving
You can't stop moving
You must join in

Oh bit

Well, nothing I said's so important
That it can't be shortened
To fit on a badge
I wish that I could be God
Try to deliver a soundbite
But it is the catch

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean

Everybody applauds her
From the lord to the hordes
And the nation is swept
By a one-to-one conversation
In adult education
I would tell her except

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

Can't say you're unattractive
But I'm out of practice
In this sort of thing
It's not like I'm talking Italian
Or I wear a medallion
And a sovereign ring

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face
What a waste
What a face

Great things can be expressed
In fifteen words or less
And bring that to your heart
Words just don't do it justice
The world and its crust
Is still drifting apart

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face
What a waste
What a face

Follow the underdog
Hold on his collar tight
This city loves a scrap
One day its gonna fight

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Cant stop me from having a good day on a bad day
There's good days and bad days

Making a night of it
Breaking the barriers
Drowning the sorrows
Upset the regulars

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from getting away with
Good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days

Oh hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey
Oh hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey

(Good days and bad days)

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Sticks and stones and animal bones
There's good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days


If you had a different attitude
Instead of taking taking to
You have missed an opportunity
And that's a really big mistake
If you had a different attitude
You'd still have good days and bad days

Hey hey hey

Like a tomato in the rain
I got that feeling again
Like a greyhound in a race
I've got a rabbit to chase
Roll under me no ones going down
You got the remedy, what?s going around?

Like a beetle on its back
I've got to get back on track
Or a police man on a tape
Waiting down in the lane
If the wheel comes off your car
Hammer it and nail it or 2
Before it falls apart
Add more nails and glue

Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?

I got that feeling again

I got that feeling again

Roll around with me, no ones going down
You got our memories it all comes back around

Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?
Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?

Getting married in the morning
Its hardly peaches and cream
We haven't got a lot in common
Except the daily routine
Nothing on the television
Just the dust on the screen
So, come on lets get together
Why don't we join a team?

[Chorus]
You might as well face it you?re addicted to drugs
You might as well face it your addicted,
You might as well face it you?re addicted to drugs
You might as well face it your addicted

Greatest poet of the sixth form
Turned out to be a fraud
Man you got a lot of buddies
How do you remember them all?





Pick the one you like
Love the one you're with
You're going down the wrong road
And it doesn't even matter

A prize in every pack
Take it from the top
You're going down the wrong road
And it doesn't even matter

Remember you're a girl, remember you're a boy
Cause interesting people always spread the joy
Interesting people, get away with it

It's time to run the race
We're all on the way
Going down the wrong road and it doesn't even matter
Show up on the day
Take it all the way
You're living in the wrong time but it doesn't even matter

Forget that you're a boy, forget that you're a girl
Cause interesting people always rule the world
Interesting people get away with it
All the time

What did you learn today?
I learned nothing
What did you do today?
I did nothing
What did you learn at school?
I didn't go
Why didn't you go to school?
I don't know

It's cool to know nothing

It's cool to know nothing

Television's on the blink
There's nothing on it
I really want to really big coat
With words on it
What do you want for tea?
I want crisps
Why didn't you join the team?
I just didn't

It's cool to know nothing

It's cool to know nothing

Take a look, take a look, take a look
At the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Here comes the referee
The light's flashing
Best bit of the day
Now that's living
Why don't you run away?
Are you kidding?
What is the golden rule?
You say nothing

It's cool to know nothing

It's cool to know nothing

Take a look, take a look, take a look
At the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Take a look, take a look, take a look
At the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Watching the people get lairy
Is not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
And not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
And old Leodiensian

La-ah-ah, la la lalala la
Ah-ah-ah, la la lalala la

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

I tried to get in my taxi
A man in a tracksuit attacked me
He said that he saw it before me
Wants to get things a bit gory
Girls run around with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat, well they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

La-ah-ah, la la lalala la
Ah-ah-ah, la la lalala la

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

Watching the people get lairy
Is not very pretty I tell thee

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

It was Saturday nite, the moon was bright
Shining down, it's harvest light
Music all around to hear, set the stage
And atmosphere--many dress to suit
Their taste, participate in the ego race
Tonite's the night, for you to be
Biggest man in history

Saturday nite's your curtain call
You found your place after all
I saw a face in the crowd
Sayin' nothin', yet talking loud

Life is just a day
Living games we play
London Bridge is fallin' down
Do what Simon says
Doing what you feel,
Games can be unreal
Humpty-Dumpty when you fall
There be no one here to call
Life is stil your mystery
You see, you see, you see

Many friends, who gather 'round
In hope, to feel safe and sound
We emphasize, to make it clear
Our stumbling nations atmosphere
While looking thru the looking glass
Our vision show, a stormy past
When you gonna wake, and see the sun--
Stop wasting time and having fun

Life is just a day
Daily games we play
London Bridge has fallen down
You did what Simon said
Doing what you feel
Games are so unreal
Humpty-Dumpty why'd you fall
You see there's no one here to call
Now we've solved this mystery
You see, you see, you see





Head down, keep your head down
Keep the rent down all the time
Hold tight, to your red stripe
Why do we fight everytime
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
Night club, Marlborough Light stub
Stuck to my gob, all the time
I treat you like the see-through
I don't mean to everytime
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth

Disgraced, back to my place
I'm a complete waste of your time
I'm asleep before the first sheep
Until the last bleep of all time
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth
What did I ever

Watching the people get lairy
Is not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
And not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
And old Leodiensian

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

I tried to get in my taxi
A man in a tracksuit attacked me
He said that he saw it before me
Wants to get things a bit gory
Girls run around with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat, well they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

Watching the people get lairy

Everyday I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I've got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The Doctor says all I needs pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less
And less and less,

I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel a rat upon a wheel
I've got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digressed
Impressed you're dressed to SOS

Oh, and my parents love me
Oh, and my girlfriend loves me
Everyday I love you less and less
I can't believe once you and me did sex
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
You're turning into something I detest
And everybody says that your a mess
Since everyday I love you less and less
And less, and less

I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel a rat upon a wheel
I've got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digressed
Impressed you're dressed to SOS

Oh, and my parents love me
Oh, and my girlfriend loves me
Oh, they keep photos of me
Oh, that's enough love for me
Oh, and my parents love me
Oh, and my girlfriend loves me
Oh, they keep photos of me
Oh, that's enough love for me

I know cause I've seen it
It was grey and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in the world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more

[Bridge]
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Take a lesson
From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can't change all our tactics
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on your own

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
This is the modern way
Faking it everyday
Taking it as they come
We're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
That this is the modern way?

I know where I'm going
I know we are in the knowing
I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want

[Bridge]





One, two, one, two, three, four

It does not move me
It does not get me going at all
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not shift me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not move me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

She does not lis-ten
She's too wrapped up with all of her things
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

This does not get to me
She's not the kind of girl that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

She does not move me
She's not the kind of girl that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not move me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not move me
(it does not move me)
It does not get me going at all

It does not shift me
(it does not shift me)
It's not the kind of thing that I like

It does not move me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus and that was that
There's more to this than passing by
There's more to this than meets the eye

I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus, I saw your shoes
They fell apart some time ago,
I'll buy some more in 5 years

[Chorus]
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing

I tell you what it's going to feel like
You've lost a limb and you can feel it
It's too late, at night, not by my side
'Cause I'm not there to hold you too tight

I tell you what it's going to be like
Well you can never hold my hand in public
They can't know or understand
That you and me are now together

[Chorus]

You can have it all if that's alright
And I will give it all to you cause you never fight
You can have it all if that's alright
And know that you can have it all if it's alright

[Chorus]

You can have it all if that's alright
And I will give it all to you cause you never fight
Before that you could have it all if that's alright
And I would give it all to you cause you never fight
Before that you could have it all if that's alright
If it's alright

You and me were made
(It's impossible to say)
To be together always
Then you moved away
(To the capital of England)
I hoped you'd stay there

Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

I came down at your
(On the national express)
Request, to touch your breasts
And now, I've found
That you, you are hanging with a crowd
A load of cheats and liars

Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Da um
Da um
Suddenly there's a knock at your head
Don't let the music come and try and take your
Ha ha ha happiness is a bowl in your hand
You've got to try and blow this party trip as far as you can

Cre Cre Cre creosote is pouring out of my brain
And tram de da do da crick in your neck
Get a room, get a head get a hat
We'll come and do the heavy where the trouble is at

Come in to the city on a Saturday night
Watching the boys on their motorbikes
I want to be like those guys, I want to wear my clothes tight
Matching jackets and a fistful of notes
New sneakers and a fresh pack of smokes

Ne ne ne nuerofen-max is a word and a mum
They're just tryin' to put the punk back into punch-a-mon
Pe pe pe pe panic over party off party on
We are birds of a feather and you can be the fat one

Come in to the city on a Saturday night
Open your heads like a satellite
I want to see what they see, I want to love you like crazy
Count your do da and you're out of your face
Can see into your room from outer space

Wa oh wa oh

Come in to the city on a Saturday night
It's not the size of the 9 til 5
I want to know what that does, I want to show you what matters
'Cause it's the size of the fire and man
that makes the difference to the size of the sham
Cut through the city on a Saturday Night
'Cause you and me are we're on the edge of the night

Cut through the city on a Saturday Night
I asked your mother and she said its alright
We're getting married when we're thirty
Gonna do it on your birthday
'Cause I don't want to waste a moment with you
I just want to live the whole night through

Cut through the city on a Saturday Night
'Cause you and me are we're on the edge of the night

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

See the stones coming at my window
See they left man no protection
T ell his family that he will be ok
K-I-LL!

Check the angles from both forces
Overcome by the need to fight it
Fight it fight it fight it fight it

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

I hear the sounds all around

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

I say!

John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD
Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key
Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir
It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear.
Sing that.

Chew the backbone,
A solar system, these clever convicts

In union station, with a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect, he chanced him where he stand
And I don't think you realize he's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check

Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts

Making his getaway threw a punched out mirror
He blend into the crowd, hear the system scream
And all those spies that strikes your head
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those omens man, I think you better run.

Checkout.

Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts.
Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts.
Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts.

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe
All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down, I said
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

I take down what I need
Cause you know I need to breathe
I'm tired of walking on another plane
Another plane cause I feel insane, I
Step back to get to you
Cut back I'm fallin' through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down, I said
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

So keep those voices down
Even if you don't make no sound
A thousand voices makin' all the mistakes
The fire escapes and this code must break
I
Step back to get to you
Cut back I'm fallin' through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down, I said
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

Standing here on this burning bridge
Trying to figure out but there's nothing here
Seem like they got the fear

Cattle grids rattle gold chains, pay it back
Just cancel the chickens
And tell your son, that he should steal the gold

Kings send their knights
Check these soul satellites
Test transmission
Is calling me back home

Too messed up to perform this,
Can't you see ill only miss you now and memories
They get washed to the seas

Feeding tape through the fabric must tune in
Unless you're trapped tomorrow
And get out the sun, get out before it gets you back

Kings send their knights
Check these souls satellites
Test transmission
Is calling me back home

And I feel, close enough,
Taste the change
Feel the rays,
Its gonna get you again,
Setting sun is coming back again

Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir
It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear.
Sing that.

Chew the backbone,
A solar system, these clever convicts

In union station, with a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect, he chanced him where he stand
And I don't think you realize he's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check

Chew the backbone,
A solar system, these clever convicts

Making his getaway threw a punched out mirror
He blend into the crowd, hear the system scream
And all those spies that strikes your head
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those OMENS man, I think you better run.

Coco believe me
I'm a lonesome man
I want to get stoned and trip some wires
I want to get myself underground
I said that, you must believe me
When I say I'm fightin' the dead
Lyin low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head?
But I got these voices that just keep singin' out
Sayin'
"I just can't stop losin' control"
"I just can't stop losin' control"
Said that "I just can't stop losin' control"

Trench wander pavement
Tryin' to score some love
In the corner of the city
Matching faces with fees
I guess that you never been here by the look upon ya face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race

Singin' out
"I just can't stop losin' control"
"I just can't stop losin' control"
Said that
"I just can't stop losin' control"
"I just can't stop losin' control"

I got these voices

I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire!
Ya know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire!
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
Waiting for the final trip
Come on it, get on it
I'm carving thru a letterbomb
I need it, loud potions
These drugs are just an hour away
Come on it, electronic
A polyphonic prostitute, the motors, on fire
Messiah for the animals

Ah, oh come on!
We got our backs to the wall!
Ah!
Get on!
And watch out!
Sayin, "Yer gonna kill us all!"

Ah I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire!
You know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire!
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
Messiah for the animals

Ah, oh come on!
We got our backs to the wall
Ah!
Get on!
And watch out! Ah!
Before you kill us all!

Ah, oh come on!
Say " we got our backs to the wall!"
Get on!
And watch out! Ah!
Before you kill us all!

No one else is here
And I can't get, since I'm nothing
No one else gets high
And I can't sleep cause I got nothing
Feeling I am lost
Control to a higher force

Music is my, my love

No one else is here
And I can't get, since I'm nothing
No one else comes clean

And I can't sleep, cause I got nothing
Feeling I am lost
Control to a higher force

Music is my, my love

Music is my, music is my, music is my

I sit and wait for you cause' this was never over
I hear the talk in codes
If you want me then come get me
You want me so come get me
I'm standing with my allies
Sellin' arms to strangers
Watch them shoot ya down

There aint nothin' I will say to you
But I know your eyes are fearin'
I watch as you creep by
I'll find my way, wont let go
I'll find my way, wont let go
I'm standing with my allies
Sellin' guns to strangers
Still dont let me sin






See, see how she dances with that cigarette in her hand
And she, she romances, everybody, like she can
She brings the lie and catches me again

Life, seen some wonders
I played my stupid games with you
Sing to me like I know you can
What girl would be?
And she nits a snare catches me again

I guess you know to keep on dancing
Like I know you can

We're gonna make it through
We're gonna make it through now
Cause we're gonna make it through
Cause we're gonna make it through now
And the circus leaves town
Cause we're gonna make it through
Yeah, said we can make it through now
Yeah, we're gonna make it through
I said we can make it through now
And the boys and their dreams
For the boys and their dreams
I know you can hear me

I feel like the time has come
A fearless rescue from everyone
Who made you the master?
The lady caster, I found you looking for a good time
I was out in exile perfecting my style
I knew you wanted a reaction

Hit me!
Harder!
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even!
Faster!
Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Try to keep up, you scatter brain
She will enter through your vein
Who was your creator?
The one who made you, the flame I need to heat the silver
You'd bring Gods to their knees pick out the bad seeds
Relieve the generals of theirs duties

Hit me! Harder! I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even! Faster! Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Who made you the master?
The Lady caster, I found you looking for a good time
Now this blood and glitter, it tastes so bitter
There's no retreat for I surrender

Hit me!
Harder!
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even!
Faster!
Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Cotton mouth is bleeding, one way glass deceiving
Dope me up on women and credit cards
Promise X-Ray vision and fancy cars
The tables set for the bourgeois
Better get in line with your dinner tray
Cause when it's all ran out and it's just you left
With the nut job swigging his crystal meth
And there's a constant ring of machinery
Is there a place for me in history?

Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, wishing for new years day
To shelter from the storm

Sons of time are rising, 16 minds exploding
It's the 21st century ain't it cool?
It's taught us how to eat and how to drool
And the wind up merchants are out in force
Telling you my brother to change your course
And you won't be the first to think it's wrong
When all you really want is to band a gong
Cause it's all sawn up in our misery
Is there a place for me in the history?

Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, wishing for new years day
To shelter from the storm

We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm

Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, wishing for new years day
To shelter from the storm

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Hey son
I'm looking forward
You're leaning backwards
Of this I'm sure

Have you had enough?
Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt?
Well if it's warm

'Cause I am taking back what's mine
I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting

Ah
I'm waiting (ah ah ah ah ah)
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone
Or something
To take me
To take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Home bred
I've got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust
I leave no scar

You say I'm old hat
A fucking dirty rat
Call me a cliche
How right you are

'Cause I am flipping bag of bones
I am righting all your wrongs
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting

Ah
I'm waiting (ah ah ah ah ah)
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone
Or something
To take me
To take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something
I get on the dark
It's the
You was at home
Chewing a monkey brain

I am out here
I'm just a silhouette
You will never
Ever ever forget

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something
I get on the dark
It's the
You was at home
Chewing a monkey brain

Out of my garden, passed the battle cruiser
We jumped over cemetery gates
There on the wasteland, we saw the horizon
I noticed your pupils dilate

They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall

Came from the booze and the fags generation
And prayed for the mayhem to start
You said you were foolish but I saw the genius
In pulling the stitches apart

They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall
So raise your glass to the ones who have passed
And the ones that got away, oh
They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall
I saw her face, way out in space

Sink like a stone, hear no sound, time stood still
Enter the void, leave no trace where you've been

Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
And all we ever wanted to be
Was floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain under a neon noon

Hands turn to dust, psychic waves fill the air
All what we have is what we've done to what we had

Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
And all we ever wanted to be
Was floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain under a neon noon

Sink like a stone, hear no sound, time stood still
All what we have is what we've done to what we had

Switchblade smiles
They go on for miles
And will be forever
Now we stand together
There's no denials

Much too soon
For the wooden spoon
Can you hear the knocking
Now your feet are stomping
Around the room

Switch blade smiles
They go on for miles
And will be forever
Now we stand together
And fill the aisles

No way back
From a shark attack
See the eyes rollover
From behind your shoulder
And fade to black

I'm a man, a man of simple pleasures
I got all I need, so give me whiskey measures
With dyslexic eyes I'm seeing very clearly
By the way, I'm on my way
But all of my life, I've been treated like a fool
But I'm no one's fool

Here I go once again trying hard to pretend
There's a future in your man made rules
I'll be governed by the road, get to shed this heavy load
I see no future, so leave me alone in the past

I am told, the world is nearly ending
But when I look outside the birds are always singing
You throw sticks and bones
Remember every dog will have it's day, I'm on my way
But all of my life, I've been treated like a fool
But I'm no one's fool

Here I go once again trying hard to pretend
There's a future in your man made rules
I'll be governed by the road, get to shed this heavy load
I see no future, so leave me alone in the past

Go on, let the righteous guide you home to where you belong
I'll stay, listen to my favorite tunes, that's where I belong

You won't take me for a ride
I'm far too fast for you to keep up with me
You won't take me for a ride
Never catch them really need no money
(I'm not gonna be standing in the line
Waiting for you just to kick me out)
You won't take me for a ride, you won't take me for a ride
You won't take me for a ride, you won't take me for a ride

I hear voices, they tell me to stop
Why should I listen,
They've never felt the drop
They hide in corners behind the pretty girls
In their
Gold in their gold in their gold
One minute to a, one minute to a, one minute to midnight
My soul you can have it cause it don't mean shit
I'd sell it to the devil for
Another hit
And midnight is coming and I wish that you were here

I hear
Voices, echo in my brain
They don't like it cause I'm not dressed the same
They
Hunt for rabbits just like Yosemite Sam
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your
Prayers
One minute to a, one minute to a, one minute to midnight

My soul you
Can have it cause it don't mean shit
I'll sell it to the devil for another hit
And
Midnight is coming and I wish that you were here
My soul you can have it cause it don't
Mean shit
I'll sell it to the devil for another hit
And midnight is coming and I
Wish that you were here

There's no need to fall, there's no need at all
Out of control on my own trying to find my way back
How did end up here And into darkness I walk as the world goes on by
Out of control on my own trying to find
My way back
How did end up here
And into darkness I walk as the world goes on by
I hear voices they tell me to stop
I hear voices they tell me to stop
I
Hear voices they tell me to stop
I hear voices they tell me to stop

Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...
Then in the middle came Motion Man...
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping way

And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below

And I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party

All for shake and made eye contact
Party control showing all that
Northeast, southwest coast
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it

A sleek skin I never nerved you
You felt lovin, I never applied a room
Without bringing the plan
By any means and means of leaving you teens,
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt

One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl

And I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all those times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy

And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said and make it expel
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter..
In the end

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes....

Hybrid
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekanetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhymes jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways write with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Ment to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound

Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land
Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest
Then I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through time
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen
A telepath of the another verse with no postage
Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage

Linkin Park [being scratched over, and over again]

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in the air's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(It watches everything)
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(It watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
But you'll find that out anyway
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast

(Forfeit the game) (you live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)

Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on.
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.
It's all too much to take in.
I can't hold on.
To end things watching everything spin.
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on.
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.
It's all too much to take in.
I can't hold on.
To end things watching everything spin.
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

How do you think
I've lost so much
I'm so afraid
I'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I watch how the moon
sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors and then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Shut up

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

There's a place so dark you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and its dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

Pushes me away

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So, even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you

You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight.

I would like to introduce

Mr. Hahn!

Let's hear it for the great

Mr. Hahn!

And now for a lesson in rhythm management, let's begin!

Alright now!
Wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else!

It goes a one, two, three

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more

Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust.

Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn,
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray,
I'll be watching far away
Right to left and left to right

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left lone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end and if you need a friend,
There's a seat here alongside me

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Whoa, whoa

No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

Victimized, victimized, never again victimized
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound comes higher on this violent rhythm
These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin'
Wanna talk about a victim, I'ma put you there with 'em!

Victimized, victimized, never again victimized
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
For you to see

Tearing me apart
With words you wouldn't say
Suddenly tomorrow's
Moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
We both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted
Secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Well it's time to begin as the summer sets in
It's the scene
You set for new lovers
You play your part painting in a new start
But each gate will open another

June, July and August said
It's probably hard to plan ahead
June, July and August said
It's better to bask in each others

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the summer go on and on

Well they tried to stay in from the cold and wind
Making love and making their dinner
Only to find that the love that they grew in the summer
Froze

February, April said
Don't be fooled by the summer again
February, April said
That half of the year, well we'll never be friends

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the winter go on and on

Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper
Seasons wait for your nod

Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born oh oh oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups oh oh oh

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old

I've got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house oh oh oh
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done oh oh oh

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old dirt road
Rambling rose (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well I'm sold

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let it die and get out of my mind
We don't see eye to eye
Or hear ear to ear

Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss?
And see this for what it is
That we're not in love

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade away, away, away

And after all it won't take long to fall in love
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
The tragedy starts from the very first spark
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

The evening was long
My guesses were true
You saw me see you
That something you said
The timing was right
The pleasure was mine

The time and the place
The look on your face
Sincerest eyes
If you're ready or not
The state of our hearts
There's no time to take

When we started
Both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening

We were caught by the light
Held onto the day
'Till it became hours
The minutes went by
The cab is outside
There's no time to take

When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

When we started both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening
When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

In my leisure suite
Quit talking
Just talking
Please

In my leisure suite
Sometimes
I feel the room surround me
With possibility

Build fires to stoke them
Let's fix what's been broken
Words have been stolen
But silence is golden

In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there

Don't come knocking
This doors for locking
Have you got the key

In my leisure suite
Hang up your jacket
Undo my back zip
Please

Moonlight on blanket
It's great when your backlit
Features in close-up
The moment we woke up

In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there

In our leisure suite
Come lie next to me
We can be complete
And do what we do when we're there

In my leisure suite

In my leisure suite

Water water on the seeds
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross Seven Seas

Maybe maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely lonely that is you
Lonely lonely that is you

Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely that is me
Lonely lonely that is me

Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tell of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

By my only things are clear
Baby boy I'm staying here
Lonely lonely that was you
Lonely and so untrue

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, for what you're trying to do

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
I ain't no vision, I am the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in my lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm

I ain't no vision, I am the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Don't try to tell me that it's over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No girl could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I am the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out

Inside and out

Inside and out

Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I should ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know

When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know

Secret heart
What are you made of
What are you so afraid of
Could it be
Three simple words
Or the fear of being overheard
What's wrong

Let her in on your secret heart

Secret Heart
Why so mysterious
Why so sacred
Why so serious
Maybe you're
Just acting tough
Maybe you're just not bad enough
What's wrong

Let her in on your secret heart

This very secret
That you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one
You're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel

Secret heart come out and share it
This loneliness, few can bear it
Could it have something to do with
Admitting that you just can't go through it alone

Let her in on your secret heart

This very secret
That you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one
That you're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel
This very secret
Go out and share it
This very secret

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
La vie c'est epatant

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
La vie je la comprends

N'allez jamais trop vite
Vous aurez tout le temps
Attention a la dynamite
Prenez garde au volcan, a ces gens enerves
Qui ne savent pas aller

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
En flanant gentiment

N'allez jamais trop vite
En aimant simplement
Pour avoir de la reussite
Soyez tres tres prudent
L'amour alors viendra
Se blottir dans vos bras

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
En flanant gentiment
En souriant gentiment
En flanant gentiment
Tout doucement

Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born oh oh oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups oh oh oh

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old

I've got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house oh oh oh
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done oh oh oh

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old dirt road
Rambling rose (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well I'm sold

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let it die and get out of my mind
We don't see eye to eye
Or hear ear to ear

Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss?
And see this for what it is
That we're not in love

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade away, away, away

And after all it won't take long to fall in love
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
The tragedy starts from the very first spark
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

The evening was long
My guesses were true
You saw me see you
That something you said
The timing was right
The pleasure was mine

The time and the place
The look on your face
Sincerest eyes
If you're ready or not
The state of our hearts
There's no time to take

When we started
Both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening

We were caught by the light
Held onto the day
'Till it became hours
The minutes went by
The cab is outside
There's no time to take

When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

When we started both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening
When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

Water water on the seeds
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross Seven Seas

Maybe maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely lonely that is you
Lonely lonely that is you

Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely that is me
Lonely lonely that is me

Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tell of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

By my only things are clear
Baby boy I'm staying here
Lonely lonely that was you
Lonely and so untrue

Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I should ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

Where was I

Well it's time to begin as the summer sets in
It's the scene
You set for new lovers
You play your part painting in a new start
But each gate will open another

June, July and August said
It's probably hard to plan ahead
June, July and August said
It's better to bask in each others

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the summer go on and on

Well they tried to stay in from the cold and wind
Making love and making their dinner
Only to find that the love that they grew in the summer
Froze

February, April said
Don't be fooled by the summer again
February, April said
That half of the year, well we'll never be friends

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the winter go on and on

Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper

All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met...

You know its time that we grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way...

All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it...

The requested track is not viewable.

Way down
I've been way down
Underneath this skin
Waiting to hear my name again

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
If I hear them calling
And nothing can hold me

Way down (Do you really want me?)
All the way down (Do you really want me?)
I will hear your voice (Do you really want me?)
But I'll no longer understand (No one's really loved me)

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling

I was looking to the sky
When I knew I'd be swimming home
And I cannot betray my kind
They are here, it's my time

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me (Do you really want me?)
I adore you still
But I hear them calling, (calling)
And nothing can hold me

Everything is so dark
And I know there's something wrong but I can't turn the light on
In that split second change when you knew we couldn't hold on
I realized I lived to love you

Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I remember

I won't give up on you
I can feel you in my heart, just show me the way
I don't belong here
Alone

I can still see your face
Where it's burned into my mind I die every time
I close my eyes, you're always there

Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back home

All across the ocean
We are calling, calling

Are, are you there?
Nothing left for me till I find you because it's

All gone the only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back
I, I can never go back home

Don't want to be the one to walk away
But I can't bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost

Can't find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Oh, we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven, help me find a way to dream within this nightmare

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
I remember why I know this place

I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me

Well, as much as it hurts,
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

I'm not afraid
I push through the pain
And I'm on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way even without wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
And we've gone to the end of the dream

Embrace the silence
'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes

Oceans between us
And there's nothing that can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison of every fall
Every breath, our ways to heal

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes

Someday you'll know the peace
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself
Will save us from the truth

Screamin' out
Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes

I've been believing in something so distant as if I was human
And I've been denying this feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me

All the promises I made just to let you down
You believed in me, but I'm broken
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

As much as I'd like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as I'd like to feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you

I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

Run away, run away
One day we won't feel this pain anymore
Take it all the way
Shadows of you
'Cause they won't let me go

So I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

Alone, and lost in paradise

It's too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world
Is tearing apart at the seams
We can't wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday
I'm waking up in someone else's life

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

Not gonna let this day go by
I'm gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it til there's nothing left
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

The water's rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this lie

Make me whole again, open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows of your lie
Cold and far away like you're not even mine
Undo everything and take me higher
Never believing what they say 'cause I'm

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I'm not giving in, I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away, I can't let you go
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below
Over and over in my mind

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I am so lost without my place inside your heart
I won't survive I need to know you hear me
Awaken and release my love

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I will wander 'til the end of time, torn away from you

I pull away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander 'til the end of time
Torn away from you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
Or from my hard heart

I can't go on living this way
And I can't go back the way I came
Shamed of this fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander 'til the end of time
Half a life without you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us, change, open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long, oh so long
Say goodbye, goodbye

My heart is broken
Release me, I can't hold on
Deliver us, my heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us, my heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold

Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away

I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me, but it's not enough

Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me, but it's not enough

Not that I so different
Not that I don't see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how could I forgive you?
You've changed
And I'm a liar by your side
I'm about to lose my mind

'Cause I've been screaming looking inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

You've been dreaming
If you're thinking
That I still belong to you
I've been dying,
'Cause I'm lying to myself

Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

Give me a reason to believe that you're gone
I see your shadows so I know they're all wrong
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me but I'm taking you home

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on

Some say I'm crazy for my love, oh my love (my love)
But no bonds can hold me from your side, oh my love
They don't know you can't leave me
They don't hear you singing to me

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
And I can't love you anymore than I do

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
And I can't love you anymore than I do

"People die, but real love is forever"





Speak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
I've just learned not to hear
Don't waste your time

It's never enough for you baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone

Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair
Don't waste your time

It's never enough for you baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made to tear up my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember when you've long forgotten me

It's never enough for you baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone

It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone

Do what you, what you want
If you have a dream for better
Do what you what you want
Till you don't want it anymore (Remember who you really are)

Do what you, what you want
Your world's closing in on you now (It isn't over)
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)
Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe we can break through

Do what you, what you want
You don't have to lay your life down (Is it over?)
Do what you what you want
Till you find what you're looking for (Got to remember who you really are)

But every hour slipping by screams that I have failed you
Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe

There's still time, close your eyes
Only love will guide you home
Tear down the walls and free your soul
Till we crash we're forever spiraling down, down, down, down

Hello, hello, it's only me
Infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to learn forgiveness

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe we can break through

Remember who you really are
Do what you want, you want

[Segment III - Of sheer perseverance]

A solace erupts at dusk fall of my shame.
Inhuman shade of glory.
I overwhelm the kingdoms at the surface...
The new culture inherited; fashions the high
Throne...

Alone in front of the Stone!
The Tome dwells...
Along the folded Manuscript!
The Siglas immune the concealed Name.
Vannished of the plane I've bannished.
Vannished of the plane I've vannished.
Bannished of the plane I've bannished.
Bannished of the plane I've vannished.

... The dust,... The dust,
... The dust restrains from my bones onto its
Ground.
The core collapses into... The length of my once
Belonged living.
The lifetime shrouded after the silence of my
Treeve...
The layer of the unknown Nights engulfs the sha-
Pen figure of a Master.
... Mounted by ascendancy!
The infinitude that my wingspread unfolds...
... Governs my blind spheres!
Visibility enclosed!
The emptiness extends openly...
... Of sheer evanescence!
Lonely...
Lonely, I'm Immortal!

Turn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breathes free
My heart is high as the waves above me
Don't need to understand
Too lost to lose
Don't fight my tears, cause they feel so good
And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

Look past the end
It's a dream, as it's always been
All life lives on if we've ever loved it

And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

Hollow like you don't remember me
Underneath everything I guess I always dreamed
That I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
But I can't save you from yourself

[Chorus]
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life?
How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear?
Holding you down until you're

Frozen
I can't let you fall apart
You don't even know
What you've done to me
But I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
If you could just wake up

[Chorus]

All alone, all alone
And drowning in your past
Take it back, take it back
I still believe you can

Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life? How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear?
Holding you down till you disappear

It's taking you too long to decide
And I don't want to be the one, the one
Crying over wasted time

If you think you're strong enough to let me in
Then come on, stand up and be honest, be honest
I'm tired of feeling so alone
'Cause you won't let me understand
I don't wanna pretend, I wanna feel, I want to love

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

Whenever you're around, I can't fight it
You get under my skin the way that I like it
And I can't take anymore
Tell me what you want from me or leave me alone
'Cause I'm all caught up and I'm losing control

I'm tired of holding on so tight
When you won't let me understand
Now I'm falling apart
I never meant to lose myself

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real
Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

Like drops of rain against my heart
Cut through like silver
And I want to make you feel that way
And I want to make you feel the way that I do

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real?
Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me

(I'm going under)

Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
I'm dying again

I'm going under, (going under)
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under, (going under)
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm

So go on and scream
Scream at me I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under

I'm dying again
I'm going under, (going under)
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm going under
Going under
I'm going under

How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside, bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me

I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
I've got to open my eyes to everything

Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul

Don't let me die here
There must be something wrong, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Long lost words whisper slowly to me
Still can't find what keeps me here
When all this time I've been so hollow inside
I know you're still there

Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I won't let you pull me down

Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head

Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching me

Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you, loving you
I won't let you pull me down

I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
It was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling

It's a heartache
Nothin but a heartache
Hit you when its too late
Hit you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feelin like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Lovin till your arms break
Then he let you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care
For you

It ain't wise to need someone

As much as I depended on
You

Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I've got a feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I don't know how I'll get down the stairs

Well it's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile on my face
When I'm going all over the place

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family comes all crawling
Slaps you on the back and saying
Please, please

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
I don't think I can take anymore

Well, clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I am stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you

He said, 'I've seen you before.'
As the band broke into Misty
I put one hand on the bar
The whole room by then
Was starting to spin

I said, 'you've got Hemingway's eyes.'
And that night I called him papa
It seems that there are so many lovers
Who hold you and yet
Whose name you forget

[Chorus]
Dance, they said
Life is only for the moment
The light is brief
Don't waste it
The taste is sweet, so taste it
So I said 'I understand
I'm dancing as fast as I can.'

Maybe we're just shooting stars
Needing something to hold on to
But each thing we touch seems to vanish
Like candles and friends
They burn at both ends

[Chorus]

He said, 'I'll see you around.'
And as I brushed my hair
I winked and said, 'you might.'
'Cause I know by now how it's done
After all the mornings after
And all the nights

[Chorus]

I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

I can see
You're slipping away from me
And you're so afraid
That I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
And let you go your way

Love is gone
There's no sense in holding on
And your pity now
Would be more than I could bare
But I'm gonna be strong
And pretend I don't care

I'm gonna be strong
And stand as tall as I can
I'm gonna be strong
And let you go along
And take it like a man

When you say it's the end
I'll hand you a line
I'll smile and say
Don't you worry I'm fine
But you'll never know darling
After you kiss me goodbye
How I'll break down and cry

There you are standin' with those teardrops in your eyes
Tellin' me you're sorry for things you've done
I've heard that same old story so many times before
I know what you're doin' and I know where you're stayin' at night

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Here I am waiting like a fool I've always been
Hopin' maybe someday you will change
The same old lies you tell me are the same old lies you live
I know what you're doin' and I know where you're sleepin' at night

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you hangin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, hey

You make me feel good
You make real good love, good, good love
You make me think about
Never being without you, way too much

My heart just can't wait, I can't think straight
I want to be with you all the time
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

Come on, baby, you make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine

You've got that something
You've got me coming back for more, that's for sure
You've got me under a spell
Wondering if you're gonna tell me, say, hey baby, I'm yours

My heart just cannot wait, I can't think straight
Just wanna be with you all the time
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

Come on, baby, you make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, all mine
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine

Each day that goes by, I want to be close by your side
Each time I'm with you I find I just lose my mind
I feel strange, I feel things like
This must be love of some kind

My heart just will not wait, I'm gonna celebrate
Just waiting for you to give me a sign
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

Just want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Oh, mine
(You make me want to make you)
Mine, mine, mine

Oh, come on, baby
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine, mine, all mine?
(You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

I really want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine, mine, all mine?
(You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

I really want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine, mine, all mine?
(You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

I really want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine?
(You make me want to make you

Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you

Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you

Guess I should accept the call
But I really don't know what to say
The operator wont let me talk at all
And she says you want me to pay
Oh well it ain't nothin new
It fits right with my picture of you
But tonight you're gonna find out
What these tears are all about

[Chorus]
'Cause this old flame went out
You never thought you'd be the one
In the darkness now
I think you know what I'm talkin about
This old flame went out

You went to get cigarettes
That was last July, you didn't get home yet
And now you expect me to hear you out
You call me collect, there ain't no doubt

[Chorus]

What do you mean, how can I do this to you?
Lets not forget who walked out on who

[Chorus]

Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I've got a feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I don't know how I'll get down the stairs

Well it's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile on my face
When I'm going all over the place

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family comes all crawling
Slaps you on the back and saying

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
I don't think I can take anymore

Well, clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I am stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you

Midnight,
and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line

Moonlight,
you're just a heartache in disguise;
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
if it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie,
thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts

Once I had a heart cold as ice
Love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun

Once I had a trick up my sleeve
And a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young boy I found

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love

Well who'd have thought that someone like you
Could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit

Listen to the story 'bout the man who tried
To drink from the river 'til the river ran dry
He drank so long and he drank so hard
The river ran dry and it broke his heart

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side 'til he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Pricked by a thorn and heart will bleed
Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side
A fool will drink 'till the river runs dry

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love (never runs)
River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Listen to the story 'bout the man who tried
To drink from the river 'til the river ran dry
He drank so long and he drank so hard
The river ran dry and it broke his heart

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side 'til he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Pricked by a thorn and heart will bleed
Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side
A fool will drink 'till the river runs dry

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love (never runs)
River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

(Verse 1)
There are times when you fell like you can't go on
There are times when you fell like giving in
And there are times when you feel like you can't try anymore
There are times of trouble in believing
This test of your faith will last
As long as it takes to pass
Till you have no more doubt you'll endure
And you faith will emerge true and pure

(Chorus)
No doubt it'll be alright
With God it'll all work together for good
No doubt in the end it will be understood
No doubt it'll all work out
With faith He can move any mountain for us
No doubt in the power of Jesus
And after all is done we find out
All we really need to have is no doubt

(Verse 2)
There's a time to take a reckless leap of faith
There's a time to be cautious and wait
And there's a way of learning from the past
That this time of trouble won't last
And sometimes we want to think we know
The ways He will choose to make us grow
But it's never the way of our choosing
And we can't always see what He's using

(Repeat chorus)

There will be winters in the seasons of our soul
With a cold and bitter wind that chills our lives
But our faith can be building a fire
That will warm us till spring time arrives

(Repeat chorus)

time to blackout no doubt

I don't know what it is about you
There's something special in your way
Yeah every time that I'm around you
I feel it when you're there
I fell it anywhere in the world that you are
Where we're hanging so low
Yes there's no

No doubt about it
Yes there's no

I've been around so many lovers
So many faces in my time
You've got that something I ain't had yet
If you want me I will say
If it's right then I'll say
Never had love so fine

Say what is yours will be mine

At the end of the day you are worn out, you are
Worn out, and too tired to sleep
But then you do dream of wonderful things
That you might do, right on through to the next
Day
And then you wake up
The sun's on your face
You're stretchin' while you're sayin'
It's a Brand New Day!

It's a brand new day and the sky is clear
So let's come together, everybody cheer
Come out people from everywhere
Let's see your faces, the day we'll share
Come on and celebrate a Brand New Day
Everyday!

Call out to the workers and the children in the
Schools
It's a day of celebration so put down your tools
And
Celebrate a Brand New Day Everyday!

Come see the mountains and come see the
Shores
Mother nature is calling so come climb aboard
And
Celebrate a Brand New Day Everyday! Let's go

At the end of the day there is no doubt you are
Worn out
Ooh but then you do dream of wonderful things

Wonderful things you might do

And then you wake up
The sun's on your face
You're stretchin' while you're sayin'
It's a Brand New Day!

Celebrate a Brand New Day, Everyday!
Celebrate a Brand New Day, Everyday!

Some chickens crossed the road
Straying far from the hen
Five reached the side one step below Zen
One was a female  four were mad men
Who moved on,  moved on,  moved on
Joined hands and moved on

Standing in line and falling asleep
Building a fence while we're counting the sheep
We'd let you help out but our project's too deep
Move on  move on  move on
Stay awake  just move on

[Chorus]
You have to understand that when it comes to making music
We meshed the styles of five alive and intertwined and fused it
Life comes from life and through our strife we strove to make the sound true
Compelled to spell it out, (No Doubt!) in search of what we must do

Our house was to small so we had to move
The neighbors had much doubts so we had to prove
That our soulful dimensions were true to the groove
We, moved on, moved on, moved on
To our house in the middle of our street

Water the music, plant the seeds in the pot
Music is life flowing through, is it not?
Don't forget your roots, but also don't rot
Move on, move on, move on
Plant the seeds and move on

[Chorus]

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings show
Wear your heart on your sleeve,
And let yourself glow, yeah

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings show...ow-ow
Wear your heart on your sleeve,
Your heart on you sleeve,
And let yourself glow, yeah

Oh
Oh
Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings, yeah,
Your heart,
And let yourself glow, yeah
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Oh

Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say,boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby
I'm the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit, lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty ways

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

[Chorus]
All the boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you had enough you'll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls want to get with the boys
And the boys really like it

[Chorus]

Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and no doubt
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
After wards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies(that's right)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
After wards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies(yea man)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
If no, no maybe, hey

Woke up this morning and felt not too cool
'Cause every time I tried to make my mouth move
The pain I'm having
Is so discomforting
Please make this suffering go away

I told my mom what I was feeling
And how long I've been dealing with it
I knew it was coming
But didn't know how soon
She said I've reached another adolescent monsoon

the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
the pain is horrendous
Why don't you lend a helpin' hand

He was a well-educated man,
Had his degree in medicine
I noticed his hairy hands
He was a very, very hairy man
He looked right down in,
Shook his head and then said
"These teeth must be pulled right away!"

the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand
the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand

He turned around,
Rolled up his sleeve
I rolled my eyes and suddenly
A horrible pain grew, the next thing that I knew
The doc had pulled my wisdom teeth...OUT!

Well along with my teeth my money also left me
As he made out the bill, I was moaning
the pain is tremendous
Where the hell is my prescription
Of codeine?

Ooh, but when will I speak, how long until
My mouth Feels natural?
How long will they bleed, when will heal?
Where's a real meal?

How do you feel? [Repeats]

I feel good
I feel great
There's no pain
There's no ache
I feel good
I feel great
Just let me recuperate

I feel good
I feel great
There's no pain
There's no ache
I feel good
I feel great
Just let me recuperate-ate-ate-ate

Because the codeine
Has left me drowsy,
Leave me be
Just let me sleep!

Get on the ball!

Please Miss Fried
He don't mean to be mean
He just needs to leave
He hopes he does not
Cause you inconvenience
Why can't you see?

He says "please don't be sad for me"

Oh Miss Fried
Please believe you're his queen
He must fight for his dreams
Lovely Miss Fried
He will too miss you
He just needs to be free

He says  "If I should ever cause you to
Bleed don't pretend to be naive"

Don't be naive

Don't take him wrong, let him be
Sometimes he feels like he ought to be alone-lone
Don't take him wrong, let him be
Sometimes he feels like he ought to be alone-lone

He says, "Please don't be sad for me"
"Please don't be sad for me"

I'm not your doormat  your floormat
So don't wipe your feet on me
I'm not the only Garibaldi
There's more fish in the sea
I'm not your puppy  your goldfish
So don't treat me like your pet
Hey  I'm not your butterfly
So don't chase me with your net

I'm not your kneaded eraser
So don't you wear me down
I'm not your sledge  (uh!) sledge hammer
I'm no tool that you pound
I'm not your blacktop  for hopscotch
So don't jump all over me
I'm not the place where the dogs roam
At the bottom of the tree

Don't you treat me like I have no feelings
Don't you treat me like that, I have feelings
Don't treat me like that
Don't you treat me like that

Like the gum on your shoe,
I'm not the ring 'round your finger
Nor am I wrapped around you
I'm not your shoe string, your rope thing
Don't tie me in a knot
I'm not your asphalt, with oil spots
So don't use me as a parking lot

Don't you treat me like I have no feelings
Don't you treat me like that, I have feelings
Don't you treat me like I have no feelings
Yeah

Sometimes sunshine
Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes I find myself blind
At first I cannot see and then I see it's me
I chose a road when I was young
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter

Sometimes I hide somewhat
Like a bulb behind a shade
And sometimes I ask myself why
Is it 'cause the lights are too bright
Or because my eyes are closed too tight

Sometimes I find myself blind
Don't use my brain don't use my mind
Distorted feelings always leading my way
But I must forgive myself and let the past lay
Down to rest
And I'll be prepared to face myself in another
Day , hey

From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved

Sometimes sunshine
Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes, sometimes
I get lost, I get lost

I chose a road when I was young
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter oh hey

From now on I will behave

Yes, MGD is the beer for me
Ah, MGD is the beer for me, that's right
MGD is the brew for me, that's right, yeah

I'm the Q to the U to the I to the K, okay?
Each day, I play my way, that's the fly way
And I'm older than a motherfucker, but they still ask me
For my ID, when I buy MGD, feel me?

'Cause I've got [Incomprehensible] in my family, uh huh
And I've got bitches that's finer than Vanity, hmm
Plus I'm not living above my means, buying Rolexes and rings
Flossing cars that I can't afford, lovin' these bitches and whores

You know, I never broke myself to see no hoe
Never did time, never took no pride in bein' cruised
Don't give a fuck about a pink slip, loose lips, sink ships
Hundred miles at least, when I sign a new lease

I never trick off my fanny with these bitches
You got to be clever, gots to keep your mind on your riches
And stop doin' the things that keep you broke
And keepin' niggaz names in your mouth
That you shouldn't have spoke, no doubt, I'm dope

In this game eight years, some of my peers have moved on
I proceed to succeed, I've stayed within my zone
I'm the baddest motherfucker, yet it's me that you despise
Look within yourself and find out why you wear that dumb disguise

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

From the low bottoms to the skies, I got 'em open
On the scrotum they blowin' like it's chronic, high hopin'
The P never leaves, be conceivin' 'em like intercourse
Up in somethin', keep 'em comin', Playa Hamm be the source

Of the force you now witness, and this is just
Another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin', P clique swangin' down the shore

Tricks out here, tryin' to make hits instead of makin it hard hittin'
And perpetratin' frauds when they spittin'
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders, you know

What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin' P's, players, we be the essence
For life, it's the JB and pimpin' Carl
When LTD we havin' it all, no doubt

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

Now I'ma tell ya straight up, one nigga planned on havin' hands on
Messin' with what I stand on, but trick you find to get ate up
I feel like a [Incomprehensible] but this pimp ahead of me
Has [Incomprehensible] to within an inner trace of the mind
Disintegrates her kind like battery acid

You never got no money from a hoe or seen my max
[Incomprehensible] buddy be somethin' broke
I'm a pimp, but you don't know
You better stand up, now empty out your purse I told you
Get out, I don't trust your ass, now throw your hands up

Take it to the bump-bump-be-ba-dump
Dip, give me my chips, witchcraft
Now let me see what I can check you with now

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in your eyes
And tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does

Ho, what, you can't see me with it, why, probably 'cause
I stay G'd up from the street up
And subject to make your trick, go get it

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now let my man press like some dookie in your mouth

DJ Quik, Hi-C, Tony Lane, stay in somethin'
Playa Hamm, oh, Bubba Brown, Clue Dog, Peter Gunz as well
El DeBarge, what's up, baby?
Ain't nothin' but a party up in here, yeah
See my fingernails done, baby
Ahh, watch how your pants feel damp, look out, girl

My life is everything
That feeds my thirst that causes sin
My wants are all I care
No shame and guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you, oh oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh

My self I'm centered in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
It's black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees

There's no defense, you'll do what I please, oh-oh!
As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh
As I climb onto your back, I promise not to sting
I tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
'Cause you knew all along I am a scorpion, ya!

My lies, to reach the shore
I aggrandize and nothing more
My hopes, to steal away
All that you love, I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain I deal is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man

In night, inside, at night
No whispers, no worries, no words
Just light fills the corner of your eye

Take me in,        take me in

Cold sky, dark Montana, long road
Running fence, radio, trucks blow by
Up high, no air, big dreams
Take me back, take me back



I want to show you everything, everything
I want to give you everything, everything

There's a chance now and then, now and then
No more cut and run, No more cut and run

Blue night, blue world, tracking you
I'm a scorpion and I'm coming after you
Running out of darkness and time
Looking for you, looking for you

Gonna sting you with a kiss from my lips
Gonna sting you with a piece of my mind
Gonna sting you with a taste of my skin
Then you're mine, then you're mine

repeat chorus

[Eve]
They usually hate her when she comes around
Huh, first lady mobbin' nigga hit the ground
Next break into that who we what a sound
Heads bopping, never fails once the Doc's around
Hating the fact that she do things on both sides
But never disrespect two rings round both eyes, right?
Lady like in many ways
Because in trust I can be crazy like on any day
Some do they dirt but best believe in time they pay
Do believe in letting shit chill til the promised day
Huh, seems they just fade away
I love it 'cause them clowns they just paved the way
Left it wide open got no time to play
Mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay
Considered snobby then just hate me I don't give a fuck
Considered sloppy to me you just need to give it up...

Eve don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is
Eve is the hottest bitch
That's what it is
But she goin' stay ladylike
That's what it is
But I'ma act crazy like
That's what it is
Think I got your house shot
That's what it is
Think I got your car burnt
That's what it is
Think I got your people robbed
That's what it is
'Cause we don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is

[Styles]
I ain't got a moment to waste
I'm trying to get to your head, so I gotta make room in your face
And they can't see your eyes or your nose
Why P? 'cause 4, 5 slugs is consuming the space
This is Holiday you need, you fuck with the Scorpion
I don't stop popping 'til your body don't breathe
Clap more than the audience, after the show
Stab more than the butcher, and I'm kinda righteous
So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push ya
She the First Lady, I'm the ghost with the gun
Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy
Ruff Ryding the clique, come up outta your shit
Get clapped in the wig, sold alot of records
But we never gave a fuck so it's a wrap for the kids
Gat to the back and the ribs
We the hood, even Holiday bitch that's what it is

[Chorus]

[Eve]
Broke out and got grown, holdin her own
That bitch come strong, give up, dead wrong
I don't even fuck around 'less your head strong
Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown
Can't figure her out
Is she street, sweet, gutter, I'm from the hood
A lot of y'all niggas gold
This bitch two million sold
And I just figured that I'd make it known
Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone
Watch me rock, got my lip cocked
Spit fire, watch it better duck, you stuck, you crossfire
Thought you was the realest you said you caught liar
Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you

[Chorus]

It's too late to change
Always the same
I can't decide
Too hard too find

Too late to change
Always the same
I can't decide
Too hard too find

It's too late to change
I can't decide

It's too late to change
Always the same
I can't decide
Too hard too find

You've been walking down the highway
Your coming into your home
As you drown in your pool of madness
Your never gonna be alone
That's why I'm here

Look up child and love your savior
The scorpion is in my eyes
Its time to strip our souls naked
The freedom of all disguise
When you take me aside
To become an immortal
The warmth's of the flesh now
Are gonna set you free

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion

I ain't the creator and I ain't satan
I come from another place
Trust with me your fingers baby
There's eternity on my face
This world ain't big enough for your questions
I deal with the stars now just to get you right

It's time you suck the cock of the Fire God

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion
The scorpion

Midnight candy four cups of coffee
I ate my breakfast with a side of eggs
I saw something in the jungle
Low in gear black mud on my legs

She was something stretch before me
Her arms into wings into pillbox heads
Can the side show wherever you go
Two naked figures in my breath

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Yeah alright
Said it's alright
Yeah alright

Alright
Said it's alright
Yeah alright

A blue light shindig well I'm addicted
Killing black kettle is what they saw
I feel like something in the congo
Dead were the women not the warriors

Last great road show a canvas tilt go
Arms into wings into pillbox heads
Creep the high-go and keep the down low
Into the mind of a melting man

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Fishes and Scorpions
In the morning sun
Dance to the changing seasons
Get away with none

Water sign in the air
Touch the earth with flame
See the friendly Sagittarian
Do you remember his name

Lovers of lions
Stay away at feeding time
Is all the Taurus takes
Mimicking life in rhyme

And can you tell me
What does it do for you girl
And can you tell me
Who is that you knew girl

In the shadow of star shine
Everyone's going blind
Lookout you don't lose your mind
I don't know if it's a fantasy
It don't mean too much to me

In the shadow of star shine
Everyone's going blind

Gemini lady
Did you see me chasing you
I don't think I did
I only tried to get through

Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of why'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of why'all ain't writin' well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta why'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

They want to bank up, crank up
It's been a week?
Shank up, haters want to come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path want to smile ?after me

Now while you grittin' your teeth
Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishin' I wrote your lines

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin', sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-are-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Dancin' much, get it all? now I'm complete, uh huh
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double are, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Uh, c'mon, uh, yo, yo

Damn she flipped it, when gone they missed it
Been on cause, they can't stop her climb
Nigga you digs it?
Want that, well you can keep that
Cause other bitches out there wack but you can't see that
E-v is top notch, i had to spot watch
To make sure i made it mine
Cause you can't cock block, came up
Fucked the game up
Now your record sales is weak but you can't blame us
Cause none can tame us, the game'll never drain us
Cause we gon' stop your shine
And it remains us
It's all good, you taking everything sweet
But it's the problems and the pressure that they can't see
I'm trying to make a quick flip
Nigga can you dig this?
Shit is real, make a mil forever be that rich bitch

[Chorus]
Where my niggas at? (what)

Uh, yo

And let some clown take my shine like i ain't working overtime
I refuse to fuck up, and lose my place i got in line, huh
Bitch please
Erased your name with ease
And it was nothing, caught you stunting got no room to breathe
Only into big things
All day spit game
Trying to put my people up on paper before shit change

Trying to get my papes right
After every show, i gotta go, i got a late flight
Thought they had us figure out
Cause we pulling figures out
Not that bitch, who is she and what's that nigga swizz about?
Questions start to come about
Thought my time was running out
But never cause i'm better under pressure, guess you figured out
Stop all the dumb shit
I came to run shit
Think i'm leaving, not at all i'm having to much fun shit

[Chorus]

Uh, yo
Y'all niggas must be bugging out
The industry we dug it out
We always keep it gangsta we change what y'all be talkin' bout
Some get away with bullshit
But they the ones who drown quick
Back on the block, hustling, scraping money up to buy a brick
Too late, cause it's over now
I done shut this whole shit down
Yeah it's me again, you outta touch bitch, fix your frown
C'mon! c'mon! uh! uh! what! what! c'mon!
Bounce [Repeats]

[Chorus]

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Eve's that girl
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Can I turn you on by my word's spell?
Look into my eyes think I want you, can't tell
Me I keep it sexy, daddy so I can't fail
Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist now cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the do-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that?
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed game game around me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't messin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch check what I've been through
Got mine took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dog I ownin' dot coms

[Chorus]

Yo, yo I can understand why you're scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me
Huh, mad cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listening to other shit?
You go the best here
Come on try your luck shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin' vouch for my behavior,
Same way they get down I get down for this paper
Sixteen lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line my world, my way any questions

[Chorus]

Uh, yo power moves is made everyday by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank anyway that I do this shit
I was born to shine while most of y'all was borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want from me, you cats is clueless,
Dispose the flow through my hands like water
Heat starts growing from my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
All ball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch swallow it up while I shut it down
Make em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookign sad at me, I ain't the blame
Back to plan be	 baby I can feel your pain

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Uh, What, Uh, My Baby,

[DMX]
Time to hit y'all cats with another joint from Eve and
the dog
And you know how we do baby creep in the fog
Now hold it down for the fellas, hold it down for the
girls
Keep motherfuckers knowing this rap shit is our world
(What!)
Been there and done that, had fun where the run
at
Don't got to shoot a motherfucker no more so put the
gun back
Pay niggas to do that, cause they a lot better at it
Keep the burner in the truck cause well you got to
have it (aight)
It's an unwritten law (uh huh)
Let a fagot open that unwritten door (uh huh)
Hit 'em with four  hairline to the jaw (what!)
That's what I'm aiming at
We going to get that nigga X aight well keep saying
that
Eve I wish you the best and I'll always love you
(what)
Never hear me say FUCK YOU because I love you (what)
Always here for you when somebody else is not
A dog and his bitch blowing up the spot
Come on


[Eve]
It should be against the law, me and the dog like a
brawl
And the only thing that can help you is God and you
should call on him
Weak sight, the streets like, creep like
Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
It ain't strange you cats know the name
Double are bubble hard it's a shame
Realest niggas doing it, them clowns they ruin it
Shut 'em down give 'em pounds cause palms go glue in it
Sticky finger niggas steal each other's style
Claiming how they started things not original
Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
If that's the case you should be considered a fan
I'm like tired of the same beats that claim streets
Doing nothing but ducking from the hood got the same
speech
Only one you feeling is you niggas know the deal
Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga


[DMX]
Since the beginning we both knew we was winning
Cause we been in all type of shit  but kept on
spitting, hitting
Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it
was the truth
So they feel that cause it's real black (WHAT!)
We never going to stop, no matter what they say

No matter what they do  they'll never take it away
(Come On)
What the Lord give you let no man curse
E-V-E and DMX from the birth to the earth

[Eve]
Why they sick cause we still close thought that it was over
Cats trying to tear us apart dogs got closer
All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
For real niggas scared us, steady catching thembluffing
What you say shut up nigga saying much of nothing
Act like they don't want it but they demand it
Double are keep it hard and niggas can't stand it





[Drag-On]
I be the D-are-A-G dash ya niggas foot slim
Cause bullets make your feet fast
We throw babies in the trash
Drag don't play with little gats
Crib like McDonald's nothing but Big Macs
And quarter pounds
Bitch place your order now stay in line
I only fuck with broke niggas
That straight depend on crime
You straight pussy so fuck your ass cap
Cause in jail they'll put your cap where
Your ass at you ass black
Projects that's where Drag at
Yea ya got heart
But if I don't got my gun
That's where ya gonna get stabbed at
Boy as a young I never grabbed that toy
Drag was taught to grab that and ask
"Where the cash at"

[Sheek]
You think we shoot his pocket sides
Deuce deuce and 25's
You ain't takin' em' nigga
You threatenin' lives
I ain't frontin motherfucker
I don't shoot no legs
I'm tryin' to see if your brains
Really look like eggs
Or is it just that commercial
Your brain on drugs
Now it's a total different look
From these shotgun slugs
To get rich it could take less than two days
I'm like them little beepers
Half's and bullets two-ways
Fuck vests my shit go through toupees
I'ma thug in New York
And when I'm on your set
We the apartment where they filmed
Good times at
Bitch what the fuck I'ma thug nigga

I'ma thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fucking with me I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing
Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thing

[Styles]
Weight on my back
Hate in my heart
Blood in my eye
Foot on the gas
Blunt in my mouth
Loving the ride
Hand on the gun
Ear to the street
Back to the wall
Mind on my money while I'm clapping at y'all

[Jadakiss]
I got niggas in jail
Crack in the hood
Hustle in south
Fiends and customers
That run in your house
I got family ties
I'm handy with knives
I live my life in the ghetto
Nose candy and nines
I'm deeper than most
Sleep wit it close
Wake wit a demon
Have visions of the whole
World shaking and screaming

[Styles]
I was born to be a leader
But if the game was dirty
I was born to be a cheater
You talking to me greasy
I was going to get the heater

[Jadakiss]
You tell me what you know about blow
Getting dough and straight warrin' with a meaner
Fronting in a Benz or I was soarin' in a Bima

[Styles]
Lyin in the cut
The gun is straight running
Like a tire on the trucks
If he is real or a liar
Put the player to his nuts
Or the fire to his guts

[Jadakiss]
Cause niggas is too soft
That heat make niggas cool off
Fuck ice I'm tryin' to cop the crew lofts

[Styles]
So we can be back in effect
I throw the barrel to the back of your neck
And hop back in the vette (corvette)

[Jadakiss]
Cause everybody is a felon with loot
Cause they say rap is like dust

[Styles and Jadakiss]
And we the only ones sellin' the juice


[Eve]

[Damien Marley]
Mack to wrist to my girl I love the best
But when you left me it's like a bullet to my chest
Now I got to say I got a bullet through vest
Knocked off my feet I pleaded no contest
Sleepless nights without no sleep or rest
This is like a muffin jury you got to mix
Take it no more and had to make her confess
Sometimes I feel I'm in the Wild, Wild West
Lost the love I had now I live to the death

[Stephen Marley (Damien Marley)]
Long as I she caught me lying I get caught for lying
If she sure believe then sure believe is the sign
But listening to promises what a fool am I
Can somebody tell me? You know all his life
I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losing my mind
The news that your moving got me standing outside
Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine
Mrs. Lovely Vessel body all mine
Girl went to shoot me with the shoot all mind
Sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
Cause there's no where to go since you left me behind
(Now it's true, true) that I loved you for truth
(true, true) she stick like ankle glue
(true, true) I make your gray skies blue
(true, true) you want me pers-nal boo
Chilling up on the house our love be that strong
DJ's steady playing on the one's and two's





First time I seen your face I was like damn
Put your arm around my waist I was like man
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man
True I'm human like you but gotta play it smart
Questions I gotta ask for we get this start
Pulse racing fast damn can you feel my heart
Got me feeling wild yeah you doing your player part
Trying to feel you up excuse me I mean feel you out
What your life like tell me what your mind about
Oh you ain't even tryin' to share no secrets straight to bis
Wifey, baby mother, you got any kids
One word answers oh I ain't feeling that
Then the pain for american express black
But I'm a play it cool and let you think you running things
You seem official long as you ain't runnin names

You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touching on me (you know you want it)
But I got go

Listen baby you know that I'm attracted to you crazy
But I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me
You ain't really telling me shit and tryin' slay me
And on the real this quiet shit is starting to drive me crazy
The only thing that's keeping me still is sex appeal
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real
Something in my mind saying that you probably got the skills
But I ain't giving in your friends they feminine
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimming in
But them lips though make me wanna try my luck
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck
Cause you dress right I'm supposed to be pressed right
But on the real you got me thinking if I could be blessed tonight
Let me stop thinking these things it's not polite
I wanna give it to you raw but I'ma put up a fight


From subliminal seduction not really touching
But like rubbing acting like you wanting nothing
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushing
Treat me like your pray only your sexual hunting
I'm running fronting cause really I'm wanting to
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushing
I'm tight vexed cause I'm really dwelling on the sex
Chills up my spine the way you smelling up my neck
I'm like putty in your hands I gotta keep my composure
Plus I'm tryin' to remember how long I really known ya
You make it hard fighting you off is like a job
But I'm doing good so far body starting to throb
Should I give in ready to open my garage
And let you park in the dark but damn I gotta
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave
You need know that dinner was lovely but I really gotta go

[Eve]
This song is a dedication to those strugglin' and livin' on
For those who can't see the light, it's comin'
Stay strong, feel me

[Teena Marie]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah,

Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

[Eve]
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year

Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me

No doubt I struggle, I cry at times
Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down

Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me

Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me
And it's funny, 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life, or they want my money

[Chorus]

[Teena Marie]
How can life be so hard?
How can my life be so hard?
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Every day I pray to God
Every day I pray
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Eve]
Been through a lot
Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Close is to do you dirty just so they can take your spot
Some days I feel like I want to quit

But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin tricks
Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind

I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes

Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin,' claimin' realness but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely

I feel like people see me really don't know me
But my best friend is Him, and I know He'll hold me

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I got a lot of people on my side protectin' me
Dee, Waah, Chivon, and the family
Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right

I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him, for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans; I love the way they love me

Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin, livin lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lot of people think I'm lucky, travelin and hangin out

But if they only knew, I +WISH+ I could be hangin out
I'm bangin out hits, in the studio I'm livin low
Makin plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin dough
Huh, come on, just so the people know
Uhh, come on, just so the people know





I'm just trying to be me, to be me!
One
Cause I really want to see the world
Two
Always knew I was a super girl
Three
Stay laced in diamonds and Pearls,that's the way you gotta treat a girl

When I was broke
Cats was like do that
Now that I got something
Cats is like screw that
They wish that I would've blew that
Back with them complaining
Spassing, Stressed out not maintaining
I move on
Speak shit, So forth and so on
You the one that made me go forth and blow on
Blew up called me cherry bond
Change my hair from blonde
Mad, because I don't go and investigate the hole Gucci line
Let me live niggas
Did this with my own rhymes
Because publishing a mother fucker baby
And I own mine
Work hard I deserve the best in life
She stay clean I deserve to be dressed up right?
She spits mean God definitely blessed her right?
We can all buy diamonds and furs
Nothing can tell
We can all buy the bar but we all can sell
Your careers yea more change your style wear a veal


Mad cause we got shit
Drop what I drop shit
Mad cause we killing it
All we do is drop hits
Long cash 21 investing to stop shit
Calling bragging way to long so I can cop shit
So now I'm suppose to down play
All the things I want in life
Got my own money now
Ain't gotta be nobody wife
Only if I want too
Not cause I need too
Choose the situations
I do and what I go through
I told you I was gonna make it big ,onna grow
This is dedicated to all the haters who don't know
But they knew what it was haters created my buzz
Talking bout me!
Made people wonder who she was?
And I'm here now
Going on my 2nd year now
Fuck it
We can take it there
Keep it at a stare down
Now I think that my message is clear now
That bitch,
E-V-E Sing it what ya hear now


Traveling to me away
Was Atlantic City now
Float me on a boat in the Atlantic feel me?
Gotta come to the table with something
Cause I got mine
Gotta spoil eve royally
Not just lay pipe lines
Saying I ain't your type line
That just means you Jelly
I said it before I can feel my own belly
Need you for what?
Yea get in where you fit
If you can I'm gonna keep it comfortable
That's my plan
Understand?
I'm just trying to be me
Bubbling Phila bitch
Course I'ma Boss and Floss

From chips to whip
Keys to her own crib
Big shit to grip
I'm living it now
Soldiers simmer it down

Too oh I remember her now!
Niggas couldn't stand her
Now they want to give her a pound
Want to know her
Cause now my feet is planted in the ground

And I'm just so ferocious to the rhythm of a high hat

Do what the fuck I wanna do 'til I die

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
Now fights between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam, pow, pow
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?

Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave those kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

"Wrong, do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
"You! Yes, you behind the bike sheds, stand still laddy!"

Overhead the albatross
Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
An echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one called us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
Something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb toward the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand
The best I can

And no one called us to the land
And no one crosses there alive
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Almost everyday you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me
To rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabys
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

Hopelessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out,
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise!

A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul

He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones,

Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

Would this do
To make it all right
While sleep has taken you
Where I'm out of sight

[Chorus]
I'll make my getaway
Time on my own
Search for a better way
To find my way home
To your smile

Wasting days and days
On this night
Always down and up
Half the night

Hopeless to reminisce
Through the dark hours
We'll only sacrifice
What time will allow us
You're sighing, sighing

All alone
Though you're right here
Now it's time to go
From your sad stare

[Chorus]

Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on  now
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship  smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.

O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more, ah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black
I've had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why. I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a room full of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front, it's red and black

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a room full of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink, a, drink, a, drink, a, drink

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away, away, away, away, away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do, I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away, away, away, away, away

Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be, a, be, a, be, a, be, a, be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.

Home
Home again
I like to be here
When I can

When I come home
Cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones
Beside the fire

Far away
Across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave those kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

"Wrong, do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
"You! Yes, you behind the bike sheds, stand still laddy!"

You! Yes, you! Stand still laddy

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives

Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on  now
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship  smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.

O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more, ah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, don't leave me
Walk around and choose your own ground

Long you live and high you fly
Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
All you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one

For long you'll live, and high you'll fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.
I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why. I call him Gerald.
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.

Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
All that you give
All that you deal
All that you buy
Beg, borrow or steal
All you create
All you destroy
All that you do
All that you say
All that you eat
And everyone you meet
All that you slight
And everyone you fight
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
And the thing that I'm beginning to know of
Let it go
I'll be there when you call
And whenever I fall at your feet
Do let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
Words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Go now
I'll be there when you call
And whenever I fall at your feet
Do let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help
Who knows where that might lead
I fall

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help
Who knows where that might lead
I fall at your feet

I have seen peace. I have seen pain,
Resting on the shoulders of your name.
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

I have seen birth. I have seen death.
Lived to see a lover's final breath.
Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?
And if you want to talk about it once again,
On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder.
You're a friend.

You and I have been through many things.
I'll hold on to your heart.
I wouldn't cry for anything,
But don't go tearing your life apart.

I have seen fear. I have seen faith.
Seen the look of anger on your face.
And if you want to talk about what will be,
Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

Annie, you had your name in the bright lights
I thought I saw your photograph
having such a laugh, in a magazine
Did it all come tumbling?

Then Annie, you were made for the big time
They said you were a star to be
In the NME
But the walls came tumbling down
Down
Will you go down on me?

Cause Annie you're a star
You're just not going very far
And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

Annie, would it be nice to be recognized?
Did you practice your autograph?
But now no ones asked
And it's such a shame
Your dreams are crumbling

Annie, why aren't you big in limelight?
Cause I thought that you said you'd be
A celebrity several years ago
But it all came tumbling down
Down
Will you go down on me?

Cause Annie you're a star
You're just not going very far
And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

Is it an evil sign?

Is it a man resigned?

Leaving you behind?
Is it ever gonna stop
Will they ever let you go
Your in a rush they don't care enough
Cause there lives are very slow
Time is ticking on

And when you sell your soul
For a leading role will the lost souls be forgot

And now your body's drained?

They will never let you go.
You're in a rush.

I really want you
I really want you

Many Prophets preach on bended knees
Many clerics wasted wine,
Do the bloody sheets and those troubled streets mean?
I have wasted time,

Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy untold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know so hard for you to do that (really want you)
Time's running out as it often does
And often dictates that you can't do that (really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you
I really want you

Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or when mother earth complained
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain

They say a million people bow and scream
To an effigy of gold
As so life begin
And the ship we're in
And history unfold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know so hard for you to do that (really want you)
Time's running out as it often does
And often dictates that you can't do that (really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you

So while I'm turning in my sheets
And once again I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go

Hello, hello

There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but
My heart is heavy does it show
I lose the track that loses me
So here I go

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

And so I sent some men to fight
And one came back at dead of night
Said he'd seen my enemy
Said he looked just like me
So I set out to cut myself
And here I go

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

And maybe someday we will face
And maybe talk but not just speak
Don't buy the promises 'Cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

Uhuh uhuh uhuh
So while I'm turning in my sheets
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
And once again I cannot sleep
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Walk out the door and up the street
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Look at the stars
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Look at the stars falling down
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
And I wonder where
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Did I go wrong?

Are you calling for our last dance?
I see it in your eyes ... in your eyes
I could use the same old lines ... but I'll sing

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out,
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I, just shone, just shone

And when silence greets my last goodbye
The words I need are in your eyes
And I'll sing

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I just shone, just shone

So shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out,
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I just shone, just shone

I have seen peace. I have seen pain,
Resting on the shoulders of your name.
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

I have seen birth. I have seen death.
Lived to see a lover's final breath.
Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?
And if you want to talk about it once again,
On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder.
You're a friend.

You and I have been through many things.
I'll hold on to your heart.
I wouldn't cry for anything,
But don't go tearing your life apart.

I have seen fear. I have seen faith.
Seen the look of anger on your face.
And if you want to talk about what will be,
Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

How I wish I could surrender my soul;
Shed the clothes that become my skin;
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
Far, far away; find comfort in pain.




I just can't believe that it's over.
We were chilling out on the sofa,
Digging how the guitar goes,
In a song that no one knows.
Did you lick that line yourself,
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Do you seem real but I seem fake?
Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?

[Chorus]
So long, Jimmy, so long.
Though you only stayed a moment,
We all know that you're the one. Singing,
So long, Jimmy, so long.
Sure we're glad for the experience,
We miss you now you've gone.
We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,
We all wish we wrote this song.
Life goes on.

I'm just so relieved that it's over.
We were hanging out going nowhere,
Digging how the guitar goes,
In a song that no one knows.
Did you burn that bridge yourself,
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Are you just cool and I'm just baked?
Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?

[Chorus]

She said to me, "Go steady on me
Won't you tell me what the wise men said?
When they came down from Heaven
Smoked nine until seven
All the shit that they could find
But they couldn't escape from you
Couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just trying to have some fun"

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Really sorry now
They weren't to know
They got caught up in your talent show
With you pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress
Who just judge each other and try to impress
But they couldn't escape from you
Couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just trying to have some fun

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Got to ask youself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask youself the question
Where are you now?

I just can't believe that it's over

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care

You touched my heart you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer but when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow

How I wish I could surrender my soul,
Shed the clothes that become my skin,
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind,
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
Far, far away, find comfort in pain.
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.

Ava Adele, I already can tell
You are the one for me
Well, it hasn't been long
But I'm already way gone
In the eyes, Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele

And I searched low and high
Never did find one thing worth dyin' for
But I'd fall to the ground
I'd go all the way down
Fightin', Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele
Yeah, my search is through, I say this to you
I love you, Ava Adele

I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, married now

I heard, that you're dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you

You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go?

I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts

Hold me closer, one more time,
Say that you love me in your last goodbye,
Please forgive me, for my sins,
Yes, I swam dirty waters,
But you pushed me in,
I've seen your face, under every sky,
Over every border and on every line,
You know my heart, more than I do,
We were the greatest, me and you,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Let me stay here for just one more night,
Build your world around me,
And pull me to the light,
So I can tell you that I was wrong,
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
I know I left you speechless

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better for you,

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and  a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more

Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free,
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again?

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning oh

She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh

But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for

When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I will never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
And I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you

Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

We all want some one to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been, where we've been

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the snigger
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia

Everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

There's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you

Just because we're having a say so
And not lining up to be play doh
In five years time will it be
Who the fuck's arctic monkeys'

'Cause everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

All the thoughts that I just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue

It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape'

Lady where's your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
?No chance, you'll get nothing from me?
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
And he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Lady where's your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing
And now realizing it won't change a thing
Realizing it won't change a thing

The requested track is not viewable.

Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
Her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

A country home, even if we really tried
Would it cease to surprise us now
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back d'ya know?

Well, I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well, spoken girls and stilettos
Aren't something to fear

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

Cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
As well as you think
And you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

Oh there ain't no love no, Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes 'n' DJ sets 'n'
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
There's a super cool band yeah
With their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
I don't want to hear your

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at the back
All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
Oh she's running to the streets outside
"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band were fucking wank
And I'm not having a nice time"

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)

Yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far
Yeah I'm sure it's pretty far

And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook

Now then Mardy Bum
I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bare

Can't we laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Yeah I'm sorry I was late
Well I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs ,oh when you say I don't care
Well of course I do, yeah I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Still it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Don't you always do the same
It's what you there for, don't you know

The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best ...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Well don't you always do the same
It's what you're there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak

And I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit frank spencer?
I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks

Never again
Never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces

Oh, spending all of your money
On trendy haircuts that you think look cool
And you're probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Oh ya know it for a fact
That everybody's eating outta your hand
What do you know?
Oh you know nothing!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
What do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing!

Fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up, and you don't look the same
I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah I'm surprised you hadn't forgotten my name
But you know it
Yeah you knew it all along
Oh you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbin', oh don't tell me I'm wrong

What do you know?
Oh you know nothing!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
What do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing, no!

Whoa

Yeah, so what do you know?
Oh you know nothing, no!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
Yes, so what do you know?
Oh you know nothing, no!

You sold your soul to the fashion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
Where's the love and the passion?
Oh I suppose that's nothing to do with you
But it's alright, put it all on one-side
And everybody's looking
You got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine

So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got chased last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they won't catch me and you

Have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
I'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in a riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

Ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
You're coming up our end aren't you
I'll get one with you
He wouldn't let us have six in
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no though
He didn't have to be rude

See her with the green dress
She talked to me at the bar
How come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Couldn't you see she were gorgeous
She were beyond belief
There was this lad at her side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Can I buy you a tropical reef?

Sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said it's High Green mate
Via Hillsborough please

Well how funny were that sketch earlier
Up at that taxi rank
Oh no you woulda missed it,
It were when you went to the bank
These two lads went round proper shouting
About who was next in the queue
The kind of thing that would seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
You're acting like a silly little boy
And they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
(They said) no surrender
No chance of retreat

And so why are we in a taxi?
Because I didn't want to leave
I said It's High Green Mate
Via Hillsborough please

Drunken plot's hatched to jump it
Ask around are you sure?
Went for it but the red light was showing
And the red light indicates doors are secured

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan, has he got one
You better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true
I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do
And I never will

Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we got in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said
I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you?
You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires

Last night these two bouncers
And one of em's alright
The other one's the scary one
His way or no way, totalitarian

He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he don't want you to

So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's now you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?

He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want, arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
This town's a different town today
This town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

That girl's a different girl today
Said that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

And over there, there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell em if you like
We'll tell em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

I said no
Oh no
Oh you won't get me to go
Anywhere, said anywhere
I won't go
Oh no no

Well over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And yeah they might overstep the line
But I just cannot get angry in the same way
Not in the same way
Not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no

Despair to the point will they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
The sheer desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

Despair to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top one hundred list

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

She saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says 'we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around

When did your list replace the twist and turn
Ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Assuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?

He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

D is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
Three quarters of an hour ago
That led him to be in a position
And every copper mission
On every other episode

He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

You knew in five minutes
But I knew in a sentence
You knew in five minutes
But I knew in a sentence

So why do we go through all of this again?
Your eyes are flutterin'
Such pretty wings.
A moth, flyin' into the
Same old flame again
It never ends

It's not like I dropped the bomb,
On my conscience mom
It takes fightin' day and night
To make such a good thing die

Out, everyone out
I give too much shit at home
In my heart and mind
It gets me every time, it gets me every time, it gets me every time

So why do we go
Through all this shit again
Your eyes are flutterin'
Such pretty wings.
A moth flyin' into me
The same old flame again
It never ends, it never ends, it never ends, it never ends

She's gone to sea
She's fightin' for me
What bravery!

I'm sleeping in a battle ship
I'm sleeping in a submarine
I'm sleeping in a fighter plane
I'm sleeping going down the drain

All hands on deck!

The radio adresss
What a mess!

A cage is a cage
Is a cage, is a cage!

We know a place where no planes go
We know a place where no ships go

(Hey!) No cars go
(Hey!) No cars go
Where we know

We know a place no space ships go
We know a place where no subs go

(Hey!) No cars go
(Hey!) No cars go
Where we know

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Cars go!)

(Hey!) Us kids know
(Hey!) No cars go
Where we know

Between the click of the light and the start of the dream

I don't want any pushing, and I don't want any shoving.
We're gonna do this in an orderly manner.
Women and children!
Women and children!
Women and children, let's go!
Old folks, let's go!
Babies needing cribs, let's go!

I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is on to us
Let's join the little babes
Throwin' rocks in front of us

Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road before our parents send for us

Trees keep fallin' at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float?
What I said was not a joke,
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope

Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!

I'll admit I'm full of shit
That's how I know I love you
That's how I know I trust you,
You're not sure if there's a right or wrong
But it feels like there is when I treat you like this
I go outside
I go outside

Texas, I won't come home
Not even if you call
I can't hear you at all
I can't explain why it's a sin the state I'm living in
I just feel so tired
I go outside
I go outside

My mouth is full, your heart is an apple
My mouth is full, my heart is an apple
Pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme

Please don't even call
I can't hear you at all.

The red lights mean you're leaving
The white one's mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning

The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold

The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms

All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world,
Types of world,
Tears of world

You wanna be set apart? Burn all of your art repair the wasteful part
I'm a vampire in a forest fire
Hey! we all gotta keep warm
Hey we all gotta keep warm, driving towards the storm

Your father was a pervert
Face down in the dirt
He taught you how to hurt
My father was a miner who lived in the suburbs
Let's live in the suburbs
If I let where I'm from burn I can never return!

My brother reads you and me his new poetry
How embarrassing
Your sister pours the gasoline
I'll fix your meals
I'll fix your meals, while your burns heal!

Find a house you don't have to rebuild
Stone by stone, brick by brick, nail by nail my father never meant to leave me this
Let this love last
I drive too fast
Said I'd return if I'd ever cared
But there's no interstate I find to take me there

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And I can fall asleep

My family tree's
Losing all it's leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat
To melt the street beneath your feet

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning how

Somethin' filled up
My heart with nothin',
Someone told me not to cry.

Now that I'm older,
My heart's colder,
And I can see that it's a lie.

Children wake up,
Hold your mistake up,
Before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children don't grow up,
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
We're just a million little god's causin' rain storms turnin' every good thing to rust.
I guess we'll just have to adjust.

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin' to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin'
With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am go-goin'

You better look down below.

Sleeping is giving in,
No matter what the time is.
Sleeping is giving
In, so lift those heavy eyelids.
People say that you'll die faster than without water.
But we know it's just a lie,
Scare your son and scare your daughter.
People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya.
Come on baby in our dreams,
We can live our misbehavior.
Every time you close your eyes lies, lies!
People try and hide the night underneath the covers.
People try and hide the light underneath the covers.

Come on hide your lovers
Underneath the covers.
Come on hide your lovers
Underneath the covers.
Hidin' from your brothers underneath the covers,
Come on hide your lovers underneath the covers.
People say that you'll die faster than without water,
But we know it's just a lie, scare your son, scare your daughter
Now here's the sun, it's alright!
Now here's the moon, it's alright!
Now here's the sun, it's alright!
Now here's the moon, it's alright!
But every time you close your eyes, lies!

And if the snow buries my, my neighborhood.
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours,
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours.

You climb out the chimney,
And meet me in the middle, the middle of the town.
And since there's no one else around,
We let our hair grow long,
And forget all we used to know.
Then our skin gets thicker from
Living out in the snow.

You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head,
As the day grows dim
I hear you sing a golden hymn

Then we tried to name our babies
But we forgot all the names that
The names we used to know.
But sometimes, we remember our bedrooms,
And our parents' bedrooms,
And the bedrooms of our friends.
Then we think of our parents,
Well what ever happened to them?!

You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head to gold,
As the day grows dim,
I hear you sing a golden hymn,
The song I've been trying to say.

Purify the colors, purify my mind.
Purify the colors, purify my mind,
And spread the ashes of the colors,
Over this heart of mine!

I woke up with the power out,
Not really something to shout about.
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are swingin' from the power lines,
Nobody's home, so nobody minds.

I woke up on the darkest night,
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light.
(We found the light)
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small.

I went out into the night.
I went out to pick a fight with anyone.
Light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.
Growin' up in some strange storm,
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are dyin' out in the snow,
Look at them go, look at them go!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.

What's the plan?

Is it a dream? Is it a lie?
I think I'll let you decide.
Just light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Cause nothin's hid, from us kids!
You ain't foolin' nobody with the lights out!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.
And there's something wrong in the heart of man,
You take it from your heart and put it in your hand!

Where'd you go?

I am waitin' 'til I don't know when,
Cause I'm sure it's gonna happen then.
Time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood,
Killing old folks, wakin' up babies
Just like we knew it would.

All the neighbors are startin' up a fire,
Burning all the old folks the witches and the liars.
My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids,
But my heart keeps watchin'
Through the skin of my eyelids.

They say a watched pot won't ever boil,
Well I closed my eyes and nothin' changed,
Just some water getting hotter in the flames.

It's not a lover I want no more,
And it's not heaven I'm pining for,
But there's some spirit I used to know,
That's been drowned out by the radio!

They say a watched pot won't ever boil,
You can't raise a baby on motor oil,
Just like a seed down in the soil
You gotta give it time.

They say it fades if you let it,
Love was made to forget it.
I carved your name across my eyelids,
You pray for rain I pray for blindness.

If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom.

The only thing that you keep changin'
Is your name, my love keeps growin'
Still the same, just like a cancer,
And you won't give me a straight answer!

If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me.

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom.

The pains of love, and they keep growin',
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love,
Since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love is not upon me
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Cause this crown is not within me.
It's not within me, it's not within me.

You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say

You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word,
The only word that I can say!

Somethin' filled up
My heart with nothin',
Someone told me not to cry.

Now that I'm older,
My heart's colder,

Well now you may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts
Well honey it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasure
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

How pink volcano in the heard of the torndao
Is shaking the lemonade tree
Hot pink forest is backed by a furnace
That boils the lemonade free

And it all went down
And it all went down
Tomorrow is a number

Hot pink apple with the sweet golden dimple
Has stuck it's claim in me
Hot pink rubber it comes in every color
And every style you please

And it all went down
And it all went down
Tomorrow is a number

Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me
That I sometimes cry
If I could pretend that I'm asleep
When my tears start to fall
I peek out from behind these walls
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows, no

Nobody likes,
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice
The one I used to hear before my life
Made a choice
But I think nobody knows
No, no
Nobody knows
No

Baby
Oh, the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And, baby, don't it feel like I'm all alone?
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home?

I think nobody knows, no
I said nobody knows
Nobody cares

It's win or lose, not how you play the game
And the road to darkness has a way
Of always knowing my name
But I think nobody knows
No, no
Nobody knows, no, no, no, no

Baby
Oh, the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And, baby, don't it feel like I'm all alone?
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home?

And, oh, no, no, no, no
Nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, no

Tomorrow I'll be there, my friend
I'll wake up and start all over again
When everybody else is gone
No, no, no

Nobody knows
Nobody knows the rhythm of my heart
The way I do when I'm lying in the dark
And the world is asleep
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me
Me

Dear Mr. President I
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's all these cracks
Crack of sunlight
Crack in the mirror, on your lips
It's the moment of a sunset, Friday
When our conversations twist
It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo
But the ice should be on our heads
We only spun a web to catch ourselves
So we weren't left for death

And I was never looking for approval from anyone but you
And though this journey is over, I'll go back if you ask me to

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink of your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight

You can do the math a thousand ways, but you can't erase the facts
That others come, and others go, but you always come back
I'm a winter flower underground, always thirsty for summer rain
And just like the change of seasons
I know you'll be back again

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink of your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight

I'm not dead just yet
I'm not dead, I'm just floating
Doesn't matter where I'm going
I'll find you
I'm not scared at all
Underneath the cuts and bruises
Finally gained what no one loses
I'll find you
I will find you

I'm not dead, just floating
I'm not scared, just changing
You're my crack of sunlight, yeah

Ha ha ha
We're gonna rock and roll
Ra, ra
All right, I drink more than you
I party harder than you do
And my car's faster than yours too

P, I, N, K
P, I, M, P
I'm back again
I know y'all missed me
I'm so so sick
Can't handle it
Yeah, I talk shit
Just deal with it

My rims are twenty-three inch
And they're black on black
No, they're not his
Diamonds all over my teeths (her teeth)
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

You know I'm rare
You stop and stare
You think I care
I don't
You talk real loud
But you ain't saying nothing cool
I could fit your whole house in my swimming pool

My life's a fantasy
That you're not smart enough to even dream
My ice is making me freeze
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

Uh
Break it down
It's tough times out here; ya know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm super thick
People say I'm much too chic
Come and kiss the ring
You just might learn a couple things
I'm trying to school you, dog
Roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof
I'm your worst nightmare
Bring it, we can take it there
What, are you scared?

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
I love you so
Much more when you're not here
Watchin' all the bad shows
Drinking all of my beer

I don't believe Adam and Eve
Spent every goddamn day together
If you give me some room, there will be room enough for two

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

I don't wanna wake up with another
But I don't wanna always wake up with you either
No, you can't hop into my shower
All I ask for is one fuckin' hour
You taste so sweet
But I can't eat the same thing every day
Cuttin' off the phone
Leave me the fuck alone
Tomorrow I'll be beggin' you to come home

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

Go away
Come back
Go away
Come back
Why can't I just have it both ways?
Go away
Come back
Go away
Come back
I wish you knew the difference
Go away
Come back

Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

Tonight
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
I'm tired
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
Tonight
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you, kiss you

Check it out, goin' out on the late night
Lookin' tight, feeling nice; it's a cock fight
I can tell I just know that it's going down, tonight
At the door, we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar, six shots just beginnin'
That's when dick head put his hands on me
But ya see

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself, guess you're out of luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
Buh-bye
Listen up, it's just not happenin'
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight, a'ight

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

You're in the corner with your boys; you bet them five bucks
You'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me

You know you are
High five and talking shit
But you are going home alone
Aren't ya?

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates,
They'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,

Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words,
This is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause You and I
We were born to die
We were born to die

My old man is a bad man, but I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have an LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you sittin', sippin' on your black Cristal, yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town 'cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again on Rikers Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy baby, I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man, but he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me, admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

He likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Tell me you own me, give me them coins

I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

You open up a beer
And you come over here
And play a video game

I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

(Now you do)

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

Life is awesome, I confess

You got nothing, I got tested
And I'm best, yes
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

Go, baby, go (Go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show (Go, go, go, go, go)

I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me is a fucking bore to me
But babe

Tell me songs at night about your favorite girl

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime
Drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

Zoomin' my miles in gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go ski it
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime
Drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo

People never die in Miami, that's what they all say

White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Dance the night away

You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?

You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
No what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

The sun also rises on those who fail to call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Dope and diamonds

I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown,
Because you like your women Spanish, dark, strong and proud.
I paint the sky black,
You said if you could have your way,
You'd make a night time what a day,
So it suits the mood of your soul
Ohhh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

Ohhhhh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue,
They're magnificent,
It don't make sense to you

Black beauty
Ohhh oh oh
Black beauty
Ohhh oh

I paint the house black,
My wedding dress black leather, too.
You have no room for light,
Love is lost on you.
I keep my lips red,
They seem like cherries in the spring.
Darling, you can't let everything seem so dark blue.

But, ohhh
What can I do,
To turn you on,
Or get through you?

Ohhh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
But you don't have a clue.
Sun and ocean blue,
They're magnificent,
It don't make sense to you.

Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh

Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black bea-u-uty,
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Black beauty baby
Black beauty baby

Ohhhh what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue,
They're magnificent,
It don't make sense to you

Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh

The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair, anywhere.

The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone
Alone

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been?
Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh

And if you call I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come
Oh-oh oh, ah-ah ah

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty

All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

I'll wait for you, babe, that's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe, you never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got my drugs and that
Like my memories, I don't need that

I'll wait for you, babe, you don't come through, babe
You never do, babe, that's just what you do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Don't say you need me when
You're leaving, you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me then
You leave last, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it best

I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Being a mistress on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
We've been around on the side
Wanna be something you would do

But you haven't seen my man

You haven't seen him

He's got the fire and he walks with fame

Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on

To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail

Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train

The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line

I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way you're heading me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could handover the keys oh

I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map

So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and got no regret
My co-pilot yeah that's right
Now I can just enjoy the ride

I'll let you lead the way now

He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window's eye

He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
Oh, let's ride and ride and ride and ride...

I am a passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backside
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight

I am a passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripped-back sky
And everything looks good tonight

Oh, the passenger
How-how he rides
Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the silent hollow sky
He see the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me

Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? one summer day,
That same night be on your way

Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
Seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were sayin' the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly.
What is a man deep down inside,
What a raging beast with nothing to hide.

Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

Permission now to let this thing land
I'm too far gone to know where I am
Conditions are worse than we planned
Permission now to let this thing land

Heading straight into the blackness
Beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

Adam took the apple, I was not involved
I'm not responsible for how lost we are
Batten down the hatches, extinction calls
But Adam took the apple, I was not involved

Heading straight into the blackness
Way beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

Maybe a rumble
Maybe nothing more
Maybe a thunder
There before she blows
Maybe not a big bang
But just a little white noise

Into the furnace of red twilight
Threading like a needle through searchlights
Fading further and spinning right
Into the furnace of red twilight

Heading straight into the blackness
Too far gone, now there's no turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

I am a passenger

Here I lay
Still and breathless
Just like always
Still, I want some more
Mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind?
Just like always
Still your passenger

The chrome buttons buckle on leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
This time won't you please
Drive faster

Roll the windows down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice cool seats
There to cushion your knees
Now to calm me
Take me around again
Just don't pull over
This time would you please
Drive faster

Roll the windows down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows down
To catch my breath
And then go and go and go just drive me
Home and back again

Here I lay just like always
Don't let me go
Take me to the edge

Caged
Hold so tight until your knuckles show
Escape
As far away as you could ever know

You sink them all down
Watch them float up
'til the wheel has spun around
You will
Be bound by what you are

Stand in the corner, with your face stripped of color
For what?

If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
Step outside and see
Another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

Chained
So many places you'd prefer to be
Than framed
By a picket fence and salary

You sink them all down
Then watch them float up
Until the
Wheel has spun around

You will be bound by who you are
Tied to the corner
With your
Hope twisted under
In knots

If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
Step outside and see another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

'Cause my everything is you
You are my everything
You give me the melody
I sing what you give to me

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you want me to
I'll let you navigate
Just let me ride with you

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you wanna go
If you show me the way
Just lead and I'll follow

Wherever you go I'll follow you
I'll be your passenger
I'll do anything to follow you
Wherever you go
I'll be your passenger, yea yea

I'll close my eyes and I'll trust you
Take me wherever you want me to go
And I'll go there
I'll go there
Even where the eyes can't see
As long as you're with me

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you want me to
I'll let you navigate
Just let me ride with you

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you wanna go
If you show me the way
Just lead and I'll follow

I've got these letters tattooed on my arm
That remind me each second of where I come from
And the long hard road to get me back home

Back to my mama who raised me up right
And back to my lady, I held every night
It's a long hard road trying to get home

I'd been gone now for too long

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home

I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

I've got this image engraved in my mind
Of a life that I had in a whole different time
It still breathes and lives at the end of the road

I've seen mountains and valleys through my missing days
But I never once parted with how you begged me to stay
I will run down that long hard and treacherous road to get home

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home

I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

I've been gone for so long
But my heart it carries on
As it pounds like a drum
On my journey back home

I've been gone for so long
But my heart it carries on
I won't give up

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home

I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

I'm just trying to get home

How can we make amends when we said all we said?
I call and you don't pick up
How can I say instead that I hope it's for the best?
I won't, and I won't give up

I'm sorry, Mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town

How can we push aside all the bad and make it right
Now you got me all choked up
I'm sorry, brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

How can we both pick sides when we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride and drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrow's filling up my cup

I'm sorry, father
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

Well some birds aren't meant to be caged
And I just can't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

How can I set us free?
I'm what you taught me to be
Shouldn't that be enough?
It's time that we make amends
Let's forget the things we said
You know we were all just stuck

I'm sorry, mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry, father
I didn't stick around
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
Just like my old man, I make my own luck

And some birds aren't meant to be caged
And some just won't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

Oh now you never come around
And then you're spacing out tonight
I bet I feel it in my chest
The visions in your head they're all lies
Oh ya it's true
Oh ya it's true

Well I
I need a friend tonight
I need to make it right
And now I'm tired of thinking
In spite
I'm always in the right
I never made the time
It's all the smiles I'm faking
(Oh oh) Oh yeah it's true

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breaking through
Feels like a dead end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keeping me from you
If I break that you hate that
So take that any way you want to

Inhale
Another thought fails
Falling off the rails
Tonight
Untamed
A c-c-crazy train
I'm always yours to blame
In your eyes
Shake a shake it off now
Then you're take a taking off now
All around so you can shoot me down
I should have gotten out before you started begging
(Oh oh) Oh yeah it's true
(Oh oh) Oh yeah it's true

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breaking through
Feels like a dead end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keeping me from you
If I break that you hate that
So take that any way you want to

(Woah woah)
(Woah woah)
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breaking through
Feels like a dead end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keeping me from you
If I break that you hate that
So take that any way you want to

(Woah) Any way any way any way
(Woah) Any way you want to
(Woah) Any way
(Woah) So take that any way you want to

Remember when we were lost at sea?
We would look at the bright night sky
Thinking of, what we could be
What we could be
How to spend our lives

Remember when we had nothing left?
We were strung out in the cold
Holding on, trying to save our breath
Trying to save our breath
We would not let go

(Whoa)
Through the good, through the bad and ugly
(Whoa)
We'll conquer anything

'Cause one day we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
With love, love

Remember down in the forest heart
We were lost, losing hope and faith
We put our trust in counting stars
We were counting stars
Trying to find our way
Remember up on the mountain top
Looking out on the rocks below
Thinking God, we will never stop
We will never stop
No we won't let go

'Cause one day we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
(Love, love)

Like a scene from the past
Where we look back and laugh
With love, love
A thought like a flash
Black and white, hope it lasts
With love, love
Like a scene from the past
Where we look back and laugh
With love, love
A thought like a flash
Black and white, hope it lasts
With love

'Cause one day we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
(Love, love)
With love, love

How can we make amends when we said all we said?
I call and you don't pick up
How can I say instead that I hope it's for the best?
I won't, and I won't give up

I'm sorry, Mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town

How can we push aside all the bad and make it right
Now you got me all choked up
I'm sorry, brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

How can we both pick sides when we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride and drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrow's filling up my cup

I'm sorry, father
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

Well some birds aren't meant to be caged
And I just can't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

How can I set us free?
I'm what you taught me to be
Shouldn't that be enough?
It's time that we make amends
Let's forget the things we said
You know we were all just stuck

I'm sorry, mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry, father
I didn't stick around
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
Just like my old man, I make my own luck

And some birds aren't meant to be caged
And some just won't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

In the jungle that we roam
To search and find and to explore
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

Pushing back remove the leaves
To find something bigger than me
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it
Hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

If I think too hard and never leave
I'll watch the world turn without me
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

To hide from lions and the wolves
Would never break the fears we hold
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it
Hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it
Hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

The requested track is not viewable.

In the morning when the sun breaks free
A reflection I know I've seen
In the night it's haunting me
A lonely ghost, a lonely gho-ost

Ever since I was just a child
I've seen visions in my sleep
Of a man running through the wild
With all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

But you can't breathe in if you don't breathe out

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim, and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts

'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

I'm looking back at a room for two
The skeletons of all we knew
That we were only broke and bruised
As you held me close along the coast

When the morning settles in
And I've learned how to live within
I can't rewind all the things I did
And all these ghosts, the lonely gho-osts

But you can't breathe in if you don't breathe out

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim, and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts

'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

Now we know we'll never be alone, alone
And we know I wanna be alone, alone

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim, and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts

'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

A lonely ghost

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

We grow apart just to be on our own
And we walk right next to all that we have known
Give me your hand, we can climb further up
And we climb the trees and the forest seems to be bigger now
Oh we had so much more

I knew she was trouble from the first kiss
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you

We take our time, to see what is up ahead
But we're scared of the past and what is left
We'll stay inside and never let out our hands
And we'll pretend that the world, it will never end
No, it will never end

I knew she was trouble from the first kiss
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you
(One, two, three, four)
I could feel it blowing in the night wind
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you

Why don't you come back down so we can turn it around
Why don't you ever know just to let it go
'Cause nothing comes around for you
So bring me back from one to two
And tell me what else I could do

I knew she was trouble from the first kiss
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you
(One, two, three, four)
I could feel it blowing in the night wind
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you

Why don't you come back down so we can turn it around

Don't feel like going home
But all my cash is gone
Yeah, I got nothing to do tonight
I'm passed out on the floor
Up in the hotel bar
But it don't matter, 'cause I'm feeling fine

I'm thinking life's too short, it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

I gave the dice a roll
And then we lost control
You know we're lucky that we survived
'Cause when we jumped the ship
Oh, man, that boat, it flipped
But we should do it all again tonight

I'm thinking life's too short, it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

Giving my body all the things I need
Rescue me with a little whiskey
Staying out, don't need no sleep
I'll sleep when I'm dead, you can bury me
I'll sleep when I'm dead, you can bury me

I guess I'm going home
'Cause all my cash is gone
I spent it all trying to feel alive
Go big or go

(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

It's getting crazy
We're gonna do some things that we won't forget
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
I'm going crazy
I'm gonna live my life, I got no regrets
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

I had a dream so big and loud

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm goin' nowhere

I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No
And I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit angry
When everyone's around
But I get a little lonely
When no one's out

I feel my demons misleading me

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
Weights off my shoulders,
It was bringin' me down (Down)

I've never been that lucky
I've never tasted fame (Fame)
I'm always lookin' for somethin'
But I hate changing

Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinnin' and I won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there

'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

(Na na na na na, nana na na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na, nana na na na na na na na na)

I don't wanna let it go!

Sometimes there's nothing to feel
Sometimes there's nothing to hold
Sometimes there's no time to run away
Sometimes you just feel so old

The times it hurts when you cry
The times it hurts just to breathe
And then it all seems like there's no-one left
And all you want is to sleep

Fight fight fight
Just push it away
Fight fight fight
Just push until it breaks
Fight fight fight
Don't cry at the pain
Fight fight fight
Or watch yourself burn again
Fight fight fight
Don't howl like a dog
Fight fight
Just fill up the sky
Fight fight fight
Fight til you drop
Fight fight fight
And never never
Never stop

Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight

So when the hurting starts
And when the nightmares begin
Remember you can fill up the sky
You don't have to give in
You don't have to give in

Never give in
Never give in
Never give in

We are almost down to the shore

Peter, Peter on the sea
Drop your nets and follow me
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't turn back
We are almost down to the shore

I said, "Fight on, fight on"
Children don't, don't you turn back
We are almost down to the shore

God told Moses on the mountain top
He said, "Keep on going and don't you stop"
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't, don't you, don't you, don't you turn back
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't turn back
We are almost down to the shore

Moses almost lost his mind
When God said, "Moses, you got to stay behind"
We are almost down to the shore

Walk together by Gods demand
Bound to reach the Promise Land
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't, don't you, don't you, don't you turn back
We are, we are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't turn back
We are all almost down to the shore

Yeah man

Gonna pulp you to a mess of bruises
Cause that's what you're looking for
There's a hole where your nose used to be
Gonna kick you out of my door

Gotta get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Gotta get into a fight

Gonna blow you to a million pieces
Blow you sky high, I don't care
Splatter matter on the bloody ceiling
Blow the building right into the air

Gotta get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Gotta get into a fight
Gonna put the boot right in
Gotta get into a fight
Yeah watch me now

What I want is power, more power
What I need is an innocent life
Want to do it in the broad daylight
I'm the truck, I'm the suicide

Gotta get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Want to get into a fight
Gonna get away with it
Gotta get into a fight
Watch me, watch me now

Yeah gotta get into a fight
Want to caught the bullet
Want to get into a fight
Gonna get away with it

It's all for the greater glory
It's all for a Saturday night
There's a hole where your face used to be
I got you in my telescope sight

Gotta get into a fight
Gonna shoot the bullet
Can't get out of it
Want to get into a fight
Gonna get away with it

I am I said
And I believe
I made it here for something

This is my time
I'm here and now
And I'll fight on
To get there

With prejudice in mind
Through fear nobody sees
Unwilling to accept
This ignorant disease.

By my own right
I have a dream
This is my life
I'm someone.

Look in my eyes
I'm everyman
Feel what I see
Inside you.

A damming of the facts
A way that's negative
Inside we're all the same
We have one live to live

The virus in the heart
Enough to seal your fate
Look deep at what you are
Itt's time to kill the hate

A narrow mind will give
A poisonned point of view
Take care of what you sow
The next one could be you

By opening the door
The end could be so sure
A joining of the hands
To seek and find a cure

I am I said
I am I said

I have a dream
I AM ALIVE

The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe.
We'll fight this battle for years to come
Till we only accept that we can stand on our own.

Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone.
To provide his family with a happy home, alone.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars.

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies.
They are trying to hold you till you'll lie,
It maybe hard, but keep your feet on the ground.
Why don't I have the finer, things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad.
So bad.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't try and get me confused.
Cause I do understand.
And sometimes people need help.
That they may need a hand
When this problems going on.
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand.
And I don't owe you a thing.
So don't think about how sorry
You feel when now your treated so bad.

This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea,
More than one person to fight the fight.
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

And as a race we look back and we've come so far.
While some may conquer,
The others had it so hard.
But instead we just complain
While there's no one for us to fight.
I guess we're born and its how we keep our side to pay.

When did you,
Last look at
At where you are?

Did, did you,
Ever think,
You'd get this far?

Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined

Have, have you,
Realized,
Just where you're from?

Will the choice,
Be, be right,
By what you've done?

Transgressive!
Ingrained
Submissive!
Enchained
Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined

What about,
The point of,
Of no return?

Whilling time,
On bridges,
That, that you burned.

Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!

Transgressive!
Ingrained

Raised by you,
You made me.

In your shadow,
Angry.

Like Father
Like Son

Mirror of your image.
Victim of your damage.

Like Father
Like Son

Like Father
Like Son

You gave me nothing
Like Father
But these memories are full.
Like Son
Is the back of your hand,
Like Father
All that I'll pass on?
Like Son

Here's what you've created.
Shattered,
Cracked,
And wasted.

Like Father
I want to know why.
Like Son

Like Father
The way that you treat me,
Like Son

Like Father
Eats away at your soul.
Like Son
And what's left is your conscience,

Like Father
That's a cancerous hole.
Like Son

I want to know why?
What I have done?
Where you a victim?
The cycle goes on

Trippin' out, oh yeah
I'm freakin' out
This sound is bouncing me
Right on the wall.

Lose myself
I can't control myself
I'm a radio head
That's in free-fall.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Hazy man, oh yeah
I'm blasted man
Out there flippin' through my
paisley mind.

Ride the wave
From cradle
To the grave
Breathe it in with my own kind.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Boned with sound, oh yeah
I'm stoned on sound
No one gets to me
Inside this room.

Spacin' out, oh yeah
I'm racing here
This sound gets in my head
My head goes boooom.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Mind's eye in darkness,
See how they run.

Fools search for nothing,
Stare at the sun.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

Talk to the madmen,
Fill them with lies.
Now pay the piper,
As honesty dies.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

Never,
Never
Blood on their hands
Never
Into quicksand.

What's left to dream for,
This endless line.

Ladders to nowhere;
Blind lead the blind.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

See how they run
Stare at the sun

Fill them with lies;
As honesty dies.

Never,
Never
Blood on their hands
Never
Into quicksand

Fight to the death!!!

Our love has drowned me in a pool of blood,
And now all we can do
is fight for our lives
We are not alone!!!
on this earth alone,
we are surrounded,
by mankind.

Black love is what its called,
and there is no looking back.

The times that we have,
are endless in time,
We will rise to ocassion
and take our revenge.

Before the day we die,
I will say I Do!!!!!!!





Think I'm possessed by demons,
I do their dirty work,
They use me like a zombie
Headaches is all I get.

Lock myself up in my own room,
Ain't comin' out my cage,
They're full of shit and no feeling,
I'll always be in a rage.

Small Deadly Space

Sympathy cries for the devil,
I dance to the music he makes.
Chemical daze, my salvation,
Destroy these losers and fakes.

Fist in the wall, care of family.
Swallow and suck till I4m full.
I need their love and attention,
Like I need lead in my skull.

Small Deadly Space

Leave me alone to my own type,
I ain't a part of the rat race,
A numberless face, just because.

I'll play along with these demons,
Possessed by them every day.
Don't try to reach out and console me,
I'll bite at what gets in my way.

Small Deadly Space

A purple bruise,
A fractured limb,
All covered up with lies.

A swollen face,
A bloody tongue,
This violence denied.

Empty now and meaningless,
Ridiculed in shame,
Until death do us apart,
Who should take the blame?

To live a lie
Forgive or die.

A stricken look,
A lowered head,
Reflections, turning back.

A trembling hand,
A quickened step,
The dreaded, next attack.

Turning from the holy ghost,
Light and spirit fade.
Waiting for deliverance,
Every thing betrayed.

To live a lie
Forgive or die.

A vacant stare,
A beat-up faith,
The book of truth reviled.

A prayer to God,
A plea for help,
Held ransom with the child.

Wide awake and holding tears,
Fear that never sleeps,
Curled up in the bed at night,
The virgin gently weeps.

To live a lie
Forgive or die

Closed into self asylum,
On ice that's paper thin.
Wrapped up for good protection.
Keep that from getting in.

The shadows bring the shelter,
Some refuge from the storm.
Brakes on the helter skelter,
To let these nerves reform.

Retreat out of the mad house,
Stop foaming at the mouth.
Hang up this strange behavior,
Cut through the overgrowth.

Watch from a safer distance,
Observe the next offense.
See how the hands do murder,
Then try to make some sens.

Black vision
Dead body
Oppression

Shock system
Explosive
Depression

Disaster
Malignant
Infection

Inhuman
Sadistic
Rejection

These acts of tender mercies,
Work on the purest soul.
They tease and trap remorseless,
Till six feet in the ground.

Shut down till all is silent,
Be still this seething blood.
Turn off, release the trigger,
Let numbness do some good

There's a man without a home,
With a girl who has no name.
There's a face in every town,
Underneath we're all the same.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on.

When the man felt down and low,
The girl was by his side.
And they walked a broken road,
With a hope that never died.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on.

If the man should find a home,
Then the girl would take his name.
But they need their open road,
For their journey is the same.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on

If I could find a place
To leave this world behind.
Somewhere in time and space
Where i could ease my mind.
I'd take you there;
Where we could be alone.

No one can find this place;
The secret will be ours.
With no more pain to face;
We'll live amongst the stars.
In solitude, and we can wonder free.

Alone, at last just you and me.

Our island universe;
A world unto its own.
Forgetting all the worst of times,
They're gone,
You know we are as one
To make a life of peace.

Escape, into eternal sleep...

Bear witness to treason
Abeyance they cower
Compulsion of liars
Addicted to power

Into the pit
Into the pit

Conspiring for sation
Malfeasance on high
Obstruction of duty
Disorder will rise

Into the pit
Into the pit

Possession by force
Reprisal to task
Defenseless no longer
Expulsion by mass

Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit





Sig sauer, victim of a systems non-control
Devour, striking terror into every soul

Communication breakdown onto self destruction
Schizophrenic people breeding hate
Pessimistic thinking from a failed connection
Survival comes when we annihilate

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun

Paranoia, termination sickness zeros good
Blind power, executing humans in cold blood

Degenerating children with an opiate bullet
Poison flows from words out on the street
Trapped inside the home that has become the prison
Dissin' everybody that we meet

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun

Locked and loaded, governmental loss to anarchy
Weapon goaded, magnum is gagging liberty

Cultural collision in an endless frenzy
Numbing minds with threats of violence
Hopeless to the dream of any decent future
Running on sheer fear and ignorance

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun





Life in black

You never were there for me
No never at all
You never took care of me
You just watched me fall

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

I placed all my faith in you
I needed you here
Christ knows what I've got to do
To rid me of fear

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

You took me for everything
As long as I live
While There's still one breath in you
I'll never forgive

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

Torn by the wrath that burns like a buried flame
Crossed in the heart from this voice that's a nagging pain
Snared to the book of God with a twisted fear
Help me from being damned by a righteous spear

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

Chained with a crooked stare that conceals a lie
Choked on a love that's judged from an evil eye
Lost in a world of hurt through a sense of doubt
Take all the numbing grief let the poison out

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

Torn by the wrath that burns like a buried flame

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin





 Love me for a little while
 Love me if you can
 'Cause I want to be your man
 And I want to understand You
 Ah...

 If you try to follow, girl
 Please stay close behind
 'Cause I want to be with you
 And I want to love you too
 Or three

 Ah, ah, ah
 Ah...
 Ah, ah, ah

 I don't want to waste your time
 I just want to make you mine
 Ah... whoa-oh-ah

 One, two, three, four, I love you
 And I always will
 'Til the sun falls off the sky
 Gonna love you 'til I die
 And more

[repeat chorus]

Do you remember me
I'm the one you talk about
Do you remember me
I'm the one you booted out

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you
No matter what in the world you say
Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway
Do you remember when
You said that I was your true love
And you'd take care of me
And watch me like the stars above

I just gotta hear you play it one time for everybody now

I just gotta hear you play it one time for the world now.

I said I'm gonna love you anyway
You know I'm gonna love you anyway

Mushroom clouds are forming
And the sky is dark and gray

Little children dying
In a age of hate and war

We can love again
Only God knows when
Help us with our problems

I don't need you bothering me
Can't you tell me that I'm free?

Mushroom clouds are forming
And the sky is dark and gray

I could love you more and more each day for a million years
And I'd sit around all day just crying happy tears

[Chorus]
To dance and sing my life away (life away)
And laughing with you, my darling, softly to me

Orange, sugar, chocolate, hot cinnamon and lovely things and you
And darling, you know there was really nothing else that I could do

And my darling you will never know how elegant
You'll always be to me
And my darling I was so in love it was evident for anyone

To see, and I suppose they already do
And how come so suddenly everything depends on you

And if I kissed you once I'd probably do it again
But then that's not so inconceivable, my friend

I just got out my little red book
        The minute that you said goodbye
        I thumbed right through my little red book
        I wasn't gonna sit and cry
        And I went from A to Z
        I took out every pretty girl in town
        They danced with me  and as I held them

        All I did was talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you... oh, no...

        There ain't no girl in my little red book
        Who could ever replace your charms
        And each girl in my little red book
        Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of
        Oh won't you please come back
        Without your precious love I can't go on
        Where can love be   I need you so much

        All I did was talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you... oh, no...

        Oh won't you please come back
        Without your precious love I can't go on
        It's haunting me   I need you so much

        All I did was talk and talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you
        All I did was talk and talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you... oh no

Do you remember me
I'm the one you talk about
Do you remember me
I'm the one you booted out

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you
No matter what in the world you say
Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

Do you remember when
You said that I was your true love
And you'd take care of me
And watch me like the stars above

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you
No matter what in the world you say
Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

I just gotta hear you play it one time for everybody now

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you

Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

I just gotta hear you play it one time for the world now.

Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

I said I'm gonna love you anyway
You know I'm gonna love you anyway.

Here's my baggage, hand me my staff
I'm leaving on a plane, a boat or raft

My love, I love, so hard to choose
If that were in my mind, it I would use
Oh...

Goin' back to Mother
Leavin' on the double
Think I'll go to Mexico

Orange skies
Carnivals and cotton candy and you
And I love you too you know I do

Nightingale
Prettier than anything in the world
And I love you too
You know I do

You make me happy
Laughing, glad, and full of glee
And you don't have to try, girl
For you it comes so naturally
Right here in my arms

Here's my baggage, hand me my staff
I'm leaving on a plane, a boat or raft

My love, I love, so hard to choose
If that were in my mind, it I would use
Oh

Goin' back to Mother
Leavin' on the double
Think I'll go to Mexico

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love

When the rain is blowing in your face,

I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

To make you feel my love





 I went to Georgia
 I went to Florida
 I went to Missi
 Tripped in Missippi, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh

 I went to Baghdad
 I went to Laurel
 Tripped in the canyon
 My head is still bent, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh

 I went to Johnny
 I went to Conka
 One of them told me
 That he was holding, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh (Ow!)

 I went to Frisco
 Bumped into Cisco
 He had a shoebox
 Behind his icebox, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh

Sometimes I feel so lonely
My comedown I'm scared to face
I've pierced my skin again, Lord
No one cares
For me

My soul belongs to the dealer
He keeps my mind as well
I play the part of the leecher
No one cares
For me, cares for me

Look out Joe, I'm fallin'
I can't unfold my arms
I've got one foot in the graveyard
No one cares
For me, cares for me

People check to tell me
What they think is right
I don't listen to them
Don't know day from night
I'll go through life searchin'
Tryin' to find the one
I'd go slip, slip, you'd go slip, slip Away

And I don't need you to help me find my way
I can make it if I just don't see your face

Once I had a problem
Didn't know what to do
Now I've got no problems
All I had was you
Guess I'll keep on searchin'
And try to find the one
'Cause I'd go slip, slip, you'd go slip, slip
Away

Hey Joe where you goin with all that money in your hand now
Well I said hey Joe where you goin with all that money in your hand

Well I said there ain't goin be no hangman putting no noose around me
Well hey Joe where you goin with all that money in your hand
Well I said hey

On all of the A's just put your finger off the be
Then put it back on then up a fret. You'll understand.

In a gazing dazzling glare
As an image stood before me
But he knew not where

A mulatto soul so rare
Intercepted by graviation
Through the mist like air

From the pits of Eden
This image he came from there

One time now
Johnny's turn now

Driven out by Eden's

I don't want to be in your company
I don't need you to take care of me
Let me alone, let me alone, let me alone, can't you let me be
All I want in this world is to say I'm a man that's free

People talk about the way I look
I say come on and say it, I got enough to write a book
But don't they know, don't they know, don't they know it's a waste of breath'
Cause I don't want to be like them, all I want is to be myself
 (Lemme hear you play it one time now)

Don't try to force your smuggled drugs my way
'Cause baby, I cleansed my soul and I say that's the way it's gonna stay
But you can put me down, all around, on the ground, anyway you choose
Get your kicks with your fix, but this time I know it's you who lose

Can't explain
Nothin' seems to be goin' right
Can't explain
Nothin' seems to be goin' right

[Chorus]
Well now you wake up in the mornin'
Find your poor self dead
Well now you wake up in the mornin'
Find your poor self dead

What a shame
You always want to start a fight
Can't explain
You always want to start a fight

[Chorus]

Let it go, what I say, yeah
Can't explain
You always want to start a fight
Can't explain
You always want to start a fight

[Chorus]

Let it go, one more time, yeah

As I sit here thinking
Wondering where I am
Knowing that I could be here but I just sat
That's where I'm at

People walk the shadows
Falling stars appear
Other blinding matches come with their cats
That's where I'm at

I could never go there
It's too close far behind
Hope I never see you
So I won't go run and hide

The requested track is not viewable.

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We kept each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild
Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild

We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (woah)
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

(You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)

You can't believe that your whole worlds shattered
You used to have it all under control
It's like you've lost everything that mattered
And you're afraid to fall
You've been though it all too many times

And though I know your pain
Without it there's no way
So the say
Yeah oh
You're lying in the rain
Letting it fall across your face
Just to feel alive

[Chorus]
So let's hear it for the ones
Who know what it feels like
To survive a broken heart
Put one hand up in the sky
Tonight
If you know what it feels like
To survive a broken heart
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)

You're searching through all the thought's you've gathered
And it feels impossible
To make it through another day
Where do you turn when your faiths been scattered
And nothing is logical
You've been through it all too many times

And you can feel your pain
But you can't win before you lose
So they say
Yeah oh
You search for who's to blame
When you let go you find the truth
Is just to feel alive

[Chorus]

A thousand pieces on the ground
How do you put them back together once again
And when your world comes crashing down
That's when you rise and find your way up
That's when you find out what you're made of

[Chorus]

Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)

'I never meant to break your heart, please forgive me.'

No I never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Please forgive me

I never meant to break your heart
I'd give my last breath before I do
Please forgive me

No I never meant to hold you down
I never meant to break your heart
Somehow, somehow
We are survivors

No I never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Here we are standing here
Survivors in the night

No I never meant to break your heart
I'll always be here for you
Here's my word, take my hand
Survivors in the night

No I never meant to let you down
I'd give my last breath before I do
All I ever wanted was to be right here
Survivors in the night

When all is said and done
We'll find a way
To put all this behind us
We'll find some way
Cause you know that I won't be leaving
Yes I'm here and I won't be leaving

No I never meant to cause you pain
No I never meant to hurt you
All I want to do now, is to try my best
Survivors in the night

When all is said and done
We'll find someday
We can forget all this
Somehow, some way

And as long as I'm here
There'll be no worries any more
And all these promises I'm making now
I'll hold each day

So don't ever, don't ever, don't forget
That I never, never meant to break your heart
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you
Survivors in the night

We are survivors in the night

Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million

I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)

I'm a survivor (what?)

Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here

Wishing you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness

The requested track is not viewable.

Cross a windy bridge one winter night
Past Embankment Gardens
Enter warmth and light
Face the music (it's never easy)
Forget the chill
Face the future (it's never easy)
Find the will
If live is worth living
It's got to be done
One might be forgiven
For thinking it's a life on the run
Many roads will cross through many lives
But somehow you survive
Look around
Picture what's in store
Is this the final edit
Or is the subject now a bore?
Don't shrug your shoulders (it's always easy)
You can't ignore
That life is worth living
It's still worth a damn
One might be forgiven for thinking
It's something of a sham
Many words may make it sound contrived
But somehow we're alive
(The Survivors)
Our heads bowed
(The Survivors)
At memorials for other faces
In the crowd
Teachers and artists (it's never easy)
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins
(It's never easy)
Or twinsets-and-pearls
If life is worth living
It's got to be run as a means of giving
Not as a race to be won
Many roads will run through many lives
But somehow we'll arrive
Many roads will run through many lives
But somehow we'll survive





When the waters is rough
The sailing is tough,
I'll get drowned in your love.
You've got a cut throat crew,
I'm gonna sink under you,
I got the bell bottom blues,
It's gonna be the death of me.
It's the graveyard watch,
Running right on the rocks,
I've taken all of the knocks.
You ain't giving me no quarter.
I'd rather drink sea water,
I wish I'd never had brought you,
It's gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor,
Gonna be the death of me,
It's gonna be the death of me.

When you're flying your flags
All my confidence sags,
You got me packing my bags.
I'll stowaway at sea,
You make me mutiny,
Where you are I won't be,
You're gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
It's gonna be the death of me

Soul survivor, that's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking
That's what I'm talking, soul survivor
Soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor

Sold 9 million

You've been my best friend all these years
You've kept holding on to me
Through all the trials and tears
Only you and I could know all
The sacrifices that let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could've said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I
We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter
I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough
To fight together in this thing for life

There were times I lost my mind took
Some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fadin' fast
We held each other close until the rain have passed
We're survivors

A little time and tenderness has
Seen us through the years
We'll still be side by side when
The final smoke has cleared
We're survivors
Together in this thing for life

Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better

When the waters is rough
The sailing is tough,
I'll get drowned in your love.
You've got a cut throat crew,
I'm gonna sink under you,
I got the bell bottom blues,
It's gonna be the death of me.
It's the graveyard watch,
Running right on the rocks,
I've taken all of the knocks.
You ain't giving me no quarter.
I'd rather drink sea water,
I wish I'd never had brought you,
It's gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor,
Gonna be the death of me,
It's gonna be the death of me.

When you're flying your flags
All my confidence sags,
You got me packing my bags.
I'll stowaway at sea,
You make me mutiny,
Where you are I won't be,
You're gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
It's gonna be the death of me

Soul survivor, that's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking
That's what I'm talking, soul survivor
Soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor

Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance
Now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge
Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the
Eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds
Still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]

Risin' up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance
Now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

[Chorus]

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

Baby, when I think about you, I think about love
Darlin', don't live without you and your love
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the Heaven 'til I'm dyin' on the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you, I think about love
Darlin' if I live without you, I live without love
And if I had the sun and moon, we will shine them
I would give you both night and day of satisfyn'

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Chaos

I wasn't expecting this
Now everything is destroyed
Underneath us are the nothings
Underneath them is a void
Beyond that void is a place
Where figments from bad dreams are banished
Childhood nightmares all come seeking
And adult lo
gic nearly vanished
Chaos
None of this is what I wanted
I truly asked for what I got
Bang the gavel, it's lawlessness
I can't unravel the knot
Half this wretched town is starving
While the other half are bloated
Everybody hates the bastards in p
ower
But their pill is sugar coated
I didn't need any of this
I feel anxiety in my neck
The consequences now apparent
Feeding back unchecked
Incessant blue in spiral coils
Fingers underneath the skin
Adrenaline is not my mistress
But she always k
knows just where I've been

I built these wings
With broken things
Found strewn in me
My nemeses

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I break and bleed
I tear, then feed
The wretchedness
Inside of me

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these
Eyes

Chaos

Reigns

It bits and holds
With fangs, so old
That loathsomeness
So bitter cold

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

Ordo ob kao, 'Order out of chaos', and the idea is that, uh, with the
influence of powerful forces behind the scene, you can bring order out of the
chaos that we see. We know, for instance, that much of the
An eerie order underneath even chaos, as if the finger of God,,
In order and disorder, is always there
I think he has nothing to support this. why-you're so full of it!
Aliens, protecting society how? Chaos happens.
There's too many people here
Gotta learn the way to turn
Hat over eye
Feeling dead more than alive
Give her something to rely on
One more time.
No one hears the sound
Fear is all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby.
No way in, no way out
Empty talk and TV shouts
Got to find the way around
No, you ain't no lifer
In this town.
No one hears the sound
Fear is all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby.
Stop the beat, hear the sound
Time has come for you to speak
Your mind
Can't you hear the sound?
Chaos all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby
Dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee
Learn to fly.

Chaos...

Power, money, holy roads
Information overload
Leave me in the bitter cold to die

Killing time has just begun
Clinging to a holy gun
Leave me in the blazing sun to die

You get nothing for nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie, goodbye

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

Breaking every promise made
Redefine a better way
Asphyxating while I pray, I'm dead

Destroy offend and terrorize
Nothing left to vandalize
You can't make me compromise, I'm dead

You get nothing for nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie, goodbye

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

So if you think you're in control
It's dragging you further down the hole
Right when you thought it all would end
All of the pain is back again
Every attempt to make it stop
Is taking you right back to the top
Nothing you do can change it now
Not that it matters anyhow

Chaos...

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

Do you remember in 1969?
Seeing all the skinheads standing in a line
Foaming at the mouth, Waiting for a fight
High boots, cropped hair, what a fucking sight

Come back of the skinhead
Come back of the boot
People that we don't beat up
We're gonna fucking shoot
We are the new breed, we will have our say
We are the new breed, we ain't gonna die

Trouble east London
Trouble in the street
On the street corners
Where the gang still meets
Talking about the weekend
What they're gonna do?
If you ain't careful
They are gonna do you!

Come back of the skinhead

People that we don't beat up

Chaos in the city
Civil war now
Skinheads taking over
Like skinheads know how
Skinhead with his boots on
Nobody's fool
Skinheads taking over
Chaos is the rule!
Chaos, chaos, chaos, don't give a toss
Chaos, chaos, chaos, don't give a toss!

Complication's my claim to fame
And I can't believe there's another
Constantly just another
I can't avoid what I can't control
And I'm losing ground
Still I can?t stand down
And I know, yeah I know, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos

It?s hard to trust anyone again
After all the let downs I've been through
Haunted by what I've been through
Air still trapped while I still can't breathe
And I'm screaming out
Give me hope somehow
And I know, yeah I know, yeah

[Chorus x2]

Chaos, chaos
I know you stay true, yeah
I know you stay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you stay true, everything around's breaking down
I know you stay true, everything around's breaking down

[Chorus x2]

Lift your head
They're a thousand miles away
Lift your heart
The sky's not coming down today
Try to understand
There's no logic in their plans
But never turn away
From the problems that we face
Turn your back
On the chaos of this town
Turn your head
From the danger that surrounds

We your rhyme sayers we lead you like a beacon
Of light out of the chaos cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare we're the winners of the game
Walk in we'l prepared climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under
Ground heard the sound of the clap made you wonder
If it was a gun the crowd or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger
Now I'm much older, lyrical clap MC's
If you don't know by now, let me aquaint you with my steez
(C'mon) I don't get on stage and waste your time
Niggaz got a lot to say but they just can't rhyme
They just babies, I snatch em out they incubators
Attach them to respirators, they breathin hard like Darth Vader
Hard as candy and suck like Now or Laters
After a while your style's tasteless and it GOT NO FLAVOR

Projects my eyesights to the heavens like dead or wise sages
Release what I hold save it through my book of rhyme pages
Scripts be ageless, like scrolls from dead sea
The cadence off and on like the motion of Tai Chi
Ba-ha-ma-D, wor-dy, to Reflect, Eternally
Science to a remedy to help and get my people free, but
Little support, got my thesis on freeze
My only option's doin bootlegs for the Japanese
Get about eight G's, a heavy buzz overseas
Sacrifice a pill to mainstream and do what I believe, cause
Down to the chromosomes I'm a purist to this artform
Enlighten who I touch and let the world catch on

Yeah, we your rhyme sayers, who lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, we're the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

Oppose for the nine, how no content sections of the earth
Walkin vexed, out of my sticks, laced on every verse
My cells begin to peak at least a hundred thousand hertz
Meanin my joint's prevalent in Fat Beats and Footworks
I cater to these markets first, cause they gravitate to me
And appreciate the vision of what I do musically

Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm!!
I walked in and they stared, see how they screwin me
Break you down, til you ain't the man you used to be
Domination of my jurisdiction, people's addiction to lies
It blurs the lines between the fact and fiction
Now we back omission, I fix your face for you, keep yappin
You start to hate the man in the mirror like Michael Jackson

Majors they try to hold me captive but mine are figure factions
But the foundation of hip-hop hold my braincells for ransom
I chance none, fuck them spots on charts and number one
If it's meant, then I'll accept it gracious when the time comes
This grassrooted curriculum, got me sprung like twisted ankles
Experience is missable, so I approach it from all angles and
Inject some substance deep inside of rap's core
Take an MC and back to where it was before

Call us Liberty like the Bell of Philadelphia scenery
Me and Bahama-D, style free like Mumia need to be
Seein me, feelin me, we right here on the level
Turnin hardrocks to pebbles, exposin the devil
Lyrical olympian like John Carlos winnin gold medal
Take that bass out yyour voice you talk to me in treble
I'm _Serious_ as Steady be	 so you know I ain't playin
I'm stimulatin, makin crowds MOVE like organizations in Philly
Keep it positive, my prerogative is exercise
See through the chaos with my third eye
Word I exhibit the exquitiness, since a child I was vivid
Throw your hands in the air if you with it, dig it

Yeah, we your rhyme sayers, who lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, we're the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

Seven-eighteen, to five-one-three
We meet at two-one-five
Reflection Eternal, Bahamadia, yes yes

Yo listen the fuck up why'all
It's Mr. X to the Z Xzibit
Broadcastin with the home grown
That's right, they straight out of my backyard
The Beat Junkies, on Rawkus Records understand me?
It's Soundbombing 2!

[Verse 1]
Yo yo yo
Now ain't nobody fuckin wit the mastermind
I'm like Einstein, a hundred and fifty times magnified
Nickel and Teslin, Jon Von Neuman

All wrapped up in the body in one human
I rhyme the tightest, shine the brightest
I blind the optic fibers in anybody's iris
When it comes to rappin, I'll smash your ass

Whether you Latin, Black or Anglo-Saxon
I'll smack you wit a backhand
That crack your back like chiropractors after lookin at your catscan
In between albums, I've become a masked man like Batman

And stalk my own rap fans
I'm like a madman fightin a war
Throwin lightning rods, swingin lightning swords
Blow you away wit a force that'll leave your body lost

Gone, nothin to mourn, nothin to do a autopsy on
I rock till I can't rock no more
'Til I can't get no mothafuckin props no more
'Til they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour

'Til 2000 B.C. ain't hot no more
I'm a dragon wit the head of a lion, jaws be like saws grindin
Claws rip through walls of cast iron
I slap fire outta hoodlum, pull out steel and start shootin

I clap iron like Duke Nukeum
Try to attack 'Bis, you get your face stomped
Flatter than a compact disc wit black Timbs
Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim
Flatter than the knife *Jigga* stabbed Un wit

[Chorus]
If you the first nigga that laugh
I'll blow you in half
The first nigga to talk trash
I'ma blow you in half
The first nigga to show your ass
I'll blow you in half
The first time'll be your last
'cause I'ma blow you in half

[Verse 2]
Yo check it *beat comes in*
I destroy your whole city block when I'm ready to rock
Blow the speaker box, magnetically shielded or not
Magnetically energy poppin gates of radio waves

Oscilate lyrics and beats copulate to pop your tape
Manipulatin space in large proportions
Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talkin
About shit like supernatural forces

Gnomes and theories and superstring theories
Most of you mothafuckers barely
Even understand the English language, much less think clearly
When I die, will I go to Heaven or Hell

Or will I end up in a place called the Van Allen Belt
I researched my roots, lookin for proof
The best place to hide a lie is between two truths
The aftermath of a nuclear blast

When the average death sentence becomes a dead paragraph
I dig a 5 by 9 rectangle in the grass
Reach your epitab and bury your ass
As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly
I'll sing all of your greatest hits, oldies on karaoke





Let it go
Oh, yeah, we got drums
Woo, Alkaholiks, let's get it crackin' y'all
Ay J-Ro, teach these niggaz how to stunt

People gather round, J-Ro is on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, sing songs called 'Survival'
Chillin' in my drawers in hotels like the Bible
Alkaholiks, West coast legends is the title

I can't shoot you with my knife, I can't stab you with my gun
So the only thing left is to hit you with the drums
Uh, huh, uhh, we in this bitch, no kickin' back
J-Ro, tell these niggaz where the fuck you sippin' at

Yo, I'm sippin' on the dock of the bay, puffin' on hay
Used to sell bombay and sip Andre
West West like Kanye, I got the rhythm like Kwame
I used to have a crush on Shante

Yo, E-Swift, I don't think that you bent
But goddamn homeboy, where all the gin went?
J-Ro, yo, I believe that's me
Say what? You up next on the Hennessey

And once you hear the Capital J, rap, it'll stay
In your brain all day, it always happens that way
I come from L.A., Cali, East side of the Valley
Dilly-dally, ran through an alley

Runnin' through an alley in my corduroy flip-flops
We drink a lot of beer so it's that West coast hip-hop
Kick box our way out of trouble, just to bubble
Meet us at the bar y'all, where everybody love you

Yo, my rhymes at parties, took out more MC's than brown Bacardi
I'm totally gnarly
Stumble through the crowd like excuse me, pardon me
Sip hops and barely 'til I pop an artery

My beats so fly, niggaz try to charter me
I'm an Alkaholik but that's only one part of me
My main man Tash is like Cool Raoul
He got bitches butt-naked in the swimming pool

I'm rowdy, I'm cocky, I'm like Jeremy Shockey
I'm a giant in this game, y'all better back up off me
You also the most frosty, drink until we saucy
Keep bitches up all night like black coffee

Yeah, you know Cinnamon, she hang with crazy Kim and them
They always in the club, tryin' to take a nigga's Benjamins
Feminine women, we be runnin' all up in 'em
Then we send 'em home broke
Because we wouldn't spend a cent on 'em

Aiyyo CaTash, a people person, shake hands and kiss babies
Politician in my mission, stack grands and spit crazy
I roll with a tight crew like Mushmouth and Russell
Girls wanna grab my love muscle and suckle

Got trees in my duffel, get a ride from the airport
I take the shuttle, no need for rebuttal
Huddle round your speaker, got the system blastin'
And we takin' everything, it ain't no need for askin'

Got the headbangin' beats, so nigga pass the aspirin
We bumrushin' the door in an un-orderly fashion
This is the year that we cash in
Catch me in Miami in the sun just baskin'

Catch me in L.A. in the streets just mashin'
The name is E-Swift, I move quick when I'm dashin'
I'm swift on the cut with my hands when I'm scratchin'
Alkaholiks back and the legacy's lastin'

Carjack used to fix flat tires (Get your ass out of the car now!)
Cadillac used to be a Benz (hey, get out of the street)
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost you in the end

I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today

He's gay used to mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed (alright)
You're played used to mean top forty

She's been waiting for that special someone
Anguished by the tears left behind them
Fortifying all that lying
Putrid taste left in her mouth

Follow me, follow me

Follow me, follow me
Down

Yeah, c'mon
Let's do the maniac
Maniac, bumping like a brainiac
Brainiac, I don't remember [?]
Land me down, touch me down at heathrow
Reach down, the first time I ever feel
Bouncers [face?] on 57th st
Calm down, I feel a cool breeze and
Not particular
I think I found a reason
[For I saw?] what I saw

She's been waiting for that special someone
But then look what she's got left
Fortifying all that lyingputrid taste left in her mouth

Reach down, the first time I ever feel
Bouncers [face?] on 57th st
Calm down, I feel a cool breeze and
Not particular
I think I found a reason
[For I saw?] what I saw

Blood runs cooler than you flow
She is hiding smiles behind whispers and tears
Chaos reaches higher ground

Chaos, chaos, chaos

You make sure you never lose
You only want to win
You use your head to find new
Ways to make people give in
Taking what they have
Becoming a good friend
But now that they have seen the light
You'll come to your end
Never giving nothing, Always giving a lie
Never giving nothing, People sussed your sly
You always take without giving
You've never heard of honesty
Times are hard for everyone else
But you can't bloody see
People queuing at your door
Begging for some food
You just slam the door on them
And tell them to get screwed

Spending money you have saved
Working all your life
Give it to the people
Who control boring life
Living without living
Fashion you must change
To be in with the in-crowd
Who live their life the same
Fashion you must change
To keep up with the trend
The money you are saving
Is coming to an end
People, they will follow
The changing of the trend
The fashion they have chosen
Will create a financial friend
Six months, they have passed
Another fashion comes
Work some boring overtime
To help the financial friend

You'll never have the authority
To be in charge of me
So don't give me your orders
Or your boring commentary
Just because you think
You're of a so called better breed
You seem to think that you're so special
But you don't fucking own me
Use me to make money
In your shitty factories
And I'll have to live and suffer
On a pathetic salary

Don't you look outside your window
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
People stare and you don't know
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
You watch people come as they go
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
Tally on and nowhere to go
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
The end is nigh or so they reckon
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
What's that flash on the horizon?
I don't know
I don't know

They're only going through a phase
Kids are all the same
They don't know their own right minds
It's only a silly game
They don't know what their talking about
They just talk a load of shit
If we just ignore them
They'll forget about it
Parental love is just a farce
Don't be taken for a ride
We know you're only young
But feel free to speak your mind
Do not work and do not pray
Ignore the bores at school
Live your life your own way
Don't be nobody's fool
Counteract the system
Youngsters are the best
Counteract the system
Become a real pest

Politicians one after one
Creating havoc and having fun
Pulling our lives to bits and pieces
Sucking and crawling like common leeches
Vote for me, I'm SDP
No vote labor, no vote Tory
You don't know which one to choose
It doesn't matter, you'll always lose
You're just a load of pointless bastards; You haven't got a brain
You're just a load of pointless bastards; You're driving me insane
What makes people vote 'em in
I can't see the reason
There's no justice in the lot of 'em
They're all just legalized treason
Police harassment on our streets
Nuclear war at our feet
Unemployment up again
It's just for their financial gain

Don't want to be your fucking hero
Don't want to be your fucking star
They use your money and exploit your name
Using people is the name of the game
They say wear bondage and a messy suit
You're just another dumb recruit
Don't know what we're gonna do
We just can't get through to you
They take your money; You work so hard
But you'll just get an unemployment card
In the day, you're just a lad
You're a poser, it ain't so bad
I ain't a poser or a fucking star
I don't drive a flash fucking car
Chaos in society, you're to blame
In years to come, it'll be the same

By and by, you knew that you make me cry. (By and by, knew you'd make me cry)
And my love for you will never die. (My love will never, never die)
But I had to find out on my own.

(Check yourself, check yourself)

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I paid no mind. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself)
All down the line. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Sometimes you just got to lose.
That's when you pay your dues.
I guess I was a fool, I guess I was a fool,
To think that... you'd stayed so true.

Aww, I really played in the game. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'd always win. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Now the tables turn. (Check yourself, check yourself)
And I'm on the losing end. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Oh don't, feel sorry.
I had it coming, it's true.
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you.

Before I go, I'd like for you to know.
You've had my heart from the very start.
But there's one more thing, before we part.
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart.

Aww, I'm on my sad way. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Because I know I'd lost your love. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'll kick it, like a pass. (Check yourself, check yourself)

But I'll be thinking of....
The good times. (The good times)
The bad times. (The bad times)
But good or bad, happy or sad,
Of memories. (Memories)
Sweet, sweet memories. (Memories)
Aww, memories... are all I have.

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they... what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Death is comin', I'm tryna warn 'em
That's why I was summoned
I know that they don't want it, they want what they can't have
Euphoria come and go and it's something you can't grab
Still, we're grasping for the emptiness, hoping we can catch something
Hand full of scars, cuts, burns, and some flesh wounds
Verge of insanity, stop me 'for I'm gone
Yeah, I say I'm gon' quit but I'm back at it in the morn'
It goes on and on and on and now I'm used to it
It's a lifestyle now and I don't know what else to do
Got a war inside my soul and it's wantin' to break through

Tell me what you're gonna do
I know that you know that I'm on
To you
I see your game and I see
The way
With my self esteem you love
To play
When I'm feeling fine things
Go alright
You're sure to be right by
My side
But when I'm down I look around
You're nowhere to be found
Here they come again
Will this ever end
Around till I need them
My plastic friends
They melt when heat begins
They're walking mannequins
My plastic friends
I wonder if you'll ever see
Exactly what you've done to me
I feel alone I've been attacked
And you put the knife into
My back
What I need is honesty
Open exchange from you to me
I've come to you my
Pride aside
So we can make this right
Three times denied I've
Relied too long on visions
Capsules of elastic
Mental prisons
Relating to the masses
For thirty pieces
Candy coated personality thin
Like reece's
Synthetic figments artificial
Pigments
[pathetic] ingesting poisons
Of facades
Illusions on a mountain high
Like Colorado
Bravado London bridges they
Be falling
Value of fools gold with
Kisses manifested
Break, smash, shatter
Counterfeit flatter
Imitation of a friend 'cause
The heat makes you scatter
Blending, comprehending but
Still deceiving
Aimless inventions creations
Spiritual manipulations
I'm running out of patience
Fascinated in your attempts
At being plastic
Spastic, kind of drastic my
Companion you are not

In this world of make believe
My eyes see what I want to see
I'm blinded with the simple lies
So easily I justify

The sin that comes so naturally
Is this all that I'll ever be
Bring this madness to an end
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride
I think I've had enough

Spinning 'round, up and down
But I know it's alright
Move ahead, falling back
Try to leave it behind

Seems I've been here before
So familiar I can tell
Need your help to get off
Of my sin carousel

It's suffice to say I move
Because of your great fortitude
So unstable are my feet
They love to make a fool of me

Afraid to fall I feel corrupt
And as I drop, you pick me up
Take me were I've never been
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride
I think I've had enough

Spinning 'round, up and down
But I know it's alright
Move ahead, falling back
Try to leave it behind

Pullin' down strongholds
Pullin' down strongholds

Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires
Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires

I got my feet dirty 'cause I'm splashing in the puddles
Got me crazy no room for rebuttals
I let down my guard like doug I got lazy
Hazy vision blurry in a hurry for immoral satisfaction

My heated passion desires, I shoulda put out the fires
That smolder in my mind, time after time, time after time
Will you help me God to just find my own way

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Actual facts keep the theories intact
Mental premonitions speaking flesh to rest
I will not go, I will not bow
Shapes and silhouettes making things complex

Unleashing chemicals give my body a sign
A loss of control leads to moral regret
Seduction, repercussion where I must defend
Entering in the trinity within to fight sin

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen to you
As a result of making these rebellations?

Inventive measures taken I feel my defenses breaking
Independent of all wisdom, secondary senses shaken
In time I arrive battered, beaten and scarred
Sensitivity charred from character barred

So hard to say goodbye to yesterday's dreamin'
Still pullin' weeds from seeds of yesterday's schemin'
Elusive representation of putting mercy to test
Confessed in midnight sessions of my desires suppressed

Entangled similes I've been meaning to comprehend
Conformed by the ways wearing dark shades
Covering up my vulnerability
You can see, I can see this lust is tempting me
To break the chains to avoid devastation, I pray for strength daily

Co-existing remedial rhymes
 with verbal signs
Disseminating inner visions
 to contrive
Broken pieces cobblestones
 they pull me down
Redirection for protection
 confessing
Animosity when your voice
 grows faint
Submission at your feet they
 feel the stings of complaint
Doing what it takes I'm
 taking table crumbs
Dependence on the one
 popularity is done
Expedient the main
 ingredient as I grasp
For the hands of providence
 to circumvent attacks
From the enemy though they
 come against me
Will I listen to your voice
 to infinity
Speak to me 'cause I long for
 your grace
Show me things as I seek
 your face
Here I am I'll do anything
Say want you want from me
A contradiction in my
 directions got me guessing
Do you listen? not to
 mention my phones off the
 hook look
I took control of
 my own path disregarded
 your wrath
Stinky like a day without a
 bath but
Internal convictions oppose
 my addictions
To inventions less eternal
 paternal
Affection from elevated places
 smiling faces
Whisper love in aimless spaces
I hear your voice won't you
 let me follow
Knees bent so we can shoot
 the breeze signs I
 can swallow
Keep the lines open like
 fiber optic hot like
 the tropic
If your driving this train
 let me hop it
Say what you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you speak to me
Wha do you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you
 speak to me

Take time, what's on your mind?
Everybody's standing on another side
It's a chance for personal gain
If you're gonna play on someone else's shame

Take time, share another life
Perfect to the end and taking on our strife
Take the time to clear up your mind
Put away yourself and open up your eyes

This time, I started waiting for myself to fade
Walking in to complications and I rearrange
Do I fear my feelings, am I numb to pain?
Are my senses washing me sane, will it ever go away?

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading

So come on it's about time
Love is so blind, you're walking on the line
Set your mind on ease, take a turn for me please
Would you please?

If you sit back, look at your life
Look at yourself and set back your pride
Take the time for what's on your mind
Put away yourself and open up your life

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Today I want to get away
I want to go some place where I can pray and
Go where the trees are tall
Where the water rushes to the falls

Fly, I want to fly away to a place where they can't find me
I, I want to see the stars that shine and I'll land on mars
And run, I want to run all day far away where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter place

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do

Today I want to get away
Where the skies are clear most every day
I'll go where the river runs
Washes away my field of pain

Fly, I want to fly up high let my spirit soar I'll kiss the sky
I want to go to the place where I find you
Run, I want to run all day to a place where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter day

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away

An urgent sense of regret and now I'm caught in the zone
My mind arrested by fear and so I go it alone
A metamorphosis conceived by the early light
Distraction of self comes out in the night

Fabricated, I'm constructed of opinions and lies
Which only leads to failing in my own eyes
Sinking to the depths while I'm masking what's inside
A bittersweet existence and I cause my own demise

And I wonder if you've ever seen life through
The eyes of one who understands what it mean
To be free, freedom comes when you can let it go
But I guess you wouldn't know

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Mind reflects the meaning to things that are jumbled
Resting on the first, making time to rehearse
Intricate persona, controlled animation
Visually impaired, clinging to pain immersed

Mentally scarred, cosmetics dripping down
Life in forward motion, exist in reverse
Instable at the seams, trying to conform
Trapped in a maze while sin is at its worst

And I wonder what your gonna do, when your
Disguise comes crashing down and yourself
Comes shining through, are you gonna hide your face?
Or let it rest in the hands of grace, grace

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade
Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade

Dimensions of intervention
Are needless so I think
Striving and thriving I see
I'm driving to the brink

Avoiding annoying eternal
Complications destinations
Unimportant constantly
Distorting my relations

From patience to thoughts of
Hating anyone in my mind
I find it hard to believe you
Can relate to my kind

And if I could I would
Pretend that I'm alright by myself
If you love me as I am I'll
Put my pride on the shelf

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
Skepticism leaves a wrinkle on my brow
Cynicism prevents my change
With this suspicion I'm caught in a dilemma

Intervention with my psyche?
Rearrange walls built to hinder
The intrusion
Preservation of my mental well being

Doubt makes me value the
Safety of my distance
Can it be stubbornness to
Which I cling?

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
And if I climb a wall of pride
Swim across my sea of doubt
Will you love me as I am, the way I am

Good, God y'all

There's no such thing as perfect strangers
So I come to you the way I am
If you call on me to sacrifice
I won't promise that I can

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

We will wake up when the moment's gone
And I'll still feel you on my fingertips
But they'll be nothing in the after burn
But the taste upon our lips

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

I'm not here tonight to rescue you
And you don't need me in your life
But I know I'll have the best of you tonight

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

you'll never know how many bridges you'll burn

I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew.
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say,
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where it felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you.

I set fire to the rain,

He is the flame
He draws me in
That burns within
It's a pain, it's so sweet, oh
The fix, the craze, by now he needs
Only I can't breathe
And I just can't pull away
Can't get away, oh, oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

My hands they're burnt, they're black, they bleed
And embers asleep
My whole world is cold now
The blaze, the heat he's putting out
Can't live without
Yeah, I just can't pull away,
Can't get away, oh, oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

Oh

Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream
While the children play in the field
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life
But how strong is the shield?
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground
Where sky is forever blue

So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud
Which may take me from you

Many things a man can lose
His self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb
To the hill up above

Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield

So trust in you love, and Lucy of above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield

The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground
And to his wish he will yield

Fate will have it's word, of course
(Think this line is wrong)
And time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield

You've fallen once, you'll fall again
And lean on
Your tired hands that crawl and grasp
The soft ground
By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

And every stone and every step
I won't recall
Emptied out of every thought
Just soft ground
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun in your eyes

Gone at last
Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

It overflows, it overflows, it always runs
It overflows, it overflows, it always runs
Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows

Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surround you, always glows
Oh

Look on your face,
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes

Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

The sky keeps staring at me
Frozen in my tracks (Nothing else to see)
And when I move my face left
You're always standing there (A shadow I can't see)
And even then I can't trace
You're walking away

I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down (Nothing I can hear)
I found the worst half in me
We're cut off at the knees (Can't even take a stand)
Against your words and beliefs
We didn't wanna freeze

(All of the years, leaving me here Gun-shy)
I don't want to say it all again (the pain, losing my aim)
Never seem to see (And why?)
Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes (Recite)
A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)

The cold keeps tearing at me
Slowing down my blood,(Unable to speak)
I left my mind long ago
Choosing some false (Always letting go)
And when I try to face you
You're walking away

(All of the years, leaving me here Gun-shy)
I don't want to say it all again (the pain, losing my aim)
Never seem to see
(And why?) Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes
(Recite) A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)

Yet again we're the only ones
No surprise, this is often how it's done
Lately it's about all I can take
I will move and mend and mold this break

Shell with another crack
I'm small but I can keep track
Too soon, everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take score, even playing fields this game
I know when all's said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Past the roaring shore
I have nothing left to hear
I'm chasing all the words
But everything you say I only see
But honestly it's fine
When I mention how I love you
It's all I do, even as I stray

We have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
My most is nothing more
Than a place we've been before
We'll draw and drag it on
I'm telling you I'm trying
To hear this out
I want nothing more to doubt
A little bit of shame

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out so long
Unhinged, unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there, still as you were

At the end of the line
It is as if there's no time at all
Nothing left to win
Every pleasure burned to the wick
Content to be alone
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
Why I'm even here

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out, so long
Unhinged, unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there, still as you were

Talk to yourself
Please make your mind up
Is there anything left
At all, all, all
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

I never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Weary when I do us wrong
But we try
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Best just lie down
And close your eyes for once
Before your will just goes

Surrounded by the throng
A mounting wave of sound
The clamor breaks me down
The ground beneath me gone
The sky might open up

Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh

Those saints in lockstep
All crossed the wasteland
Forever gone
They'll hum and walk along

Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

And it calls you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please, not so long
This time

Too young and thoughtless
To calm your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone

Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright

And it'll call you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please, not so long
This time

Move on, let's face
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time, no place
When all you hope is that everything breaks

No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No bliss, no light
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
I'm still the lucky one

Prove it all to me
Check again to see
Leave me with no words
If you call again it's absurd
And I know I've made it all a lie
Shuffled back and forth it's only in my eyes
And I always want to rescind
Everything I bought into, there's no name

Fool me once, it's fair
The flood gates need repair
I count on you and why
There's nothing there besides
And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign
Another back and forth, turn around
One that makes no sense, but it feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
Where you are you and I stay me

If I draw you upside down I can let go
Leaves my mind at ease gives me something to focus on
Could I be alone?
Could I be alone?

If I speak in rounds for a while letting my tongue swell
I'll be sure to try and explain myself to dispel
Blame it on the day
Blame it on the day

Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost, what's left before it's gone

But what makes each step worth the time and regret still shows
In the cradle of my unruly chest you belong
Take it as it is
Make another fist

Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost, what's left before it's gone

Dreamed a long day
Just wandering free
Though I'm far gone
You sleep nearer to me

If I could find peace
If this night bleeds
But I can't help myself

So I walk out
These wandering dreams
Of the north road
Dressed gold and green

If I could lie still
As that grey hill
But I can't help myself

But it's calm and it's clear
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked

And those figures through the leaves
And that light through the smoke
And those countless empty days
Made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way
Than straight on out the door

And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself

Sometimes I'm battle weary
I forget to use my shield
The arrows pierce my armor
And I stumble in the filed

A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

I'll think my life is over
But the Lord he comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And he sets me on my feet

A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

Sometimes your battle weary
But the war's already won
Keep your head and hold your shield high
'Til your days of life are done

A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

So much violence in our name
A life, a silence masked in shame

Children running in the streets
Soldier boots are on their feet
Mothers bare the burdens of our defeats
Fathers are on their knees praying for mercy

So much violence in our name
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
So much violence in our name
A life, a silence masked in shame

No more, no more, no more (no more)
No more, no more, no more (no more)
No more, no more, no more (no more)
No more, no more, no more (no more)

Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield

No more violence in our name

No more, no more, no more

How do you propose to live your life in times like these

Growing up surrounded by the fear and hate disease

I believe that we all need protection from the world

And our friends enfold us like a barrier unfurled

I believe in the human shield

I believe in the human shield

People try to use you and abuse you every day

Doesn't seem to matter what you do or what you say

Then you need a friend that you can count on when you're down

Someone who will ward off all the hatred all around

The human shield protects your soul

And keeps you on the ground

The human shield protects your heart from being ground down

Dreams will all be shattered and your hopes dashed on the ground

As you grow to realise, this world's a real hard town
I believe that we all need protection every day
And our friends will form a shield that works in every way

I believe in the human shield
I believe in the human shield

(Chorus)

I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

A you've been makin' your brags around town
That you've been a lovin' my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what a you look like to me
And what I see's a pity
You better close your face and stay outta my way
If ya don't wanna go to fist city

If ya don't wanna go to fist city
Ya better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift a you off a the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint 'cause he ain't
N' that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man
If ya don't wanna go to fist city

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet
If you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called fist city

If you don't wanna go to fist city
You better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift you offa the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint 'cause he ain't
N' that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man
If ya don't wanna go to fist city
I'm here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man
If ya don't wanna go to fist city

striking out at everyone
feels like no one's listening
suddenly it's not the same
you've been sleeping all this time
throw your fist into the air
for all the trouble you went through
where are you know
are you so cool you don't care
for everything you tried to prove
the time is now
seeing the world through colored glass
picture postcards of your life
welcome to the world outside
this is where your troubles lie
staring straight into the sun
burn the cobwebs from your eyes
you're just up against yourself
there is nothing left to hide

Gotta make this money
Gotta make this money
This money is me
This money is everything I do and see

Who are you to judge me
Just let me be and let me breathe
I see this whole world headed for damnation
And I'm ready to leave

I can't believe this whole world twisted me
You fuckin' biggets, you fakes, you want to-be's
I see the future and its lookin' grim
A lake of fire lookin' like a gonks whip

I'm a fist of rage (one foot in the grave)
I'm a fist of rage (far from saved)
I'm a fist of rage (in a broken state)
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a wrist of hate)
I'm a fist of rage!
I'm a fist of rage!
I'm a fist of rage!
Crack another bottle and let me knock one back

Huh-huh, Slim Jim's
And the tin men grins
Fat heads with dreads
And all the feds growing shark fins

Huh-huh, my girls knocked up
We're in love but she's young and yo I think I'm being locked up
I couldn't cut the mustard with a Ginsu
And a twist of brown for all the bullshit I been through

I'm looking for love but it's got too many damn faces
I can't win even with these four aces
My place is here in the mix with the tricks and sickos
I spend g's but only make nickels

My soul tickles
But this ain't even fun and games
My heart bleeds from the pleasures of the pain
My fuse is short and it's lit like me I'm short

It's sketchy
It's getting hard to see
My heart bleeds believe it every dying breath
These people take and they take
Until there's nothing left

I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage! (one foot in the grave)
I'm a fist of rage! (far from saved)
I'm a fist of rage! (in a broken state)
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a wrist of hate)
Trouble

Ya feeling bold with me
You're up a creek
And you don't know it
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it
And I know it

'Cause the fear you hide your eyes show it
Payback on your ass cause you're over due and I know I owe it
Now when your goin' down bet I'll be blowing up
Hear the sound of a shotgun cock and realize you're fucked

I hope you see my middle finger from the stage
(Feel me coming, feel me coming, feel me coming, feel me coming)

I'm a fist of rage (one foot in the grave)
I'm a fist of rage (far from saved)
I'm a fist of rage (in a broken state)
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a wrist of hate)

If you that call, if you that jump
Arms in the air, Shawty do the fist pump

Don't really wanna see me no more
Can't say we gang high, ballin' like a bank shot

From standin' up when we leave the club
I'm a call that shit a miracle

Twist up, mixed up, twist up
And her booty too big for the seats in my coup
I'm a have to put it in the pick-up truck

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Carry forth as a guardian to Kingdom Come
With your daggers of the spirit
Let the dagger run
With the Fist of Fire
Be the master now
As the darkness of ages past

Riches silver and gold
In the liquid see
Cast a net can you catch
So you can't see me

As in death you can climb
Higher through the sky
Show your wings
Surely you can fly

Fly away past the guardian to Kingdom Come
See the miracle of life
Disappear it's gone

Go carry your silver ships of light
Go carry your silver ships of light
Go carry your silver ships of life
Go carry your silver ships of life
Go carry your silver ships of life

Keep the fire in your hand
It won't let you drown
As you fly with your wings
Won't come falling down

See the flower of youth
Disappear on high
As you gather your true wings
About to fly

To be ready
To be strong
Make it run

This righteous
This wrong
This right
This love

This is how nature controls
The way of all things
this is how the angels sing
Not afraid
No, not afraid
Not afraid of this or that
Not afraid

Carry forth as a guardian to Kingdom Come
With the ghost
And the spirit
Let the fire run

through the darkest age
We can surely fly
through the darkest age
With the Fist Of Fire
through the darkest age
With the Fist of Fire

Well now I've been on my own for many a year
Seems like I'll never get loved
Got me a hand on this brother of mine
And I'm gonna get me the rub
Turn me the lights down to a purple glow
Put Bessie Smith on the wail
Bring me the five young daughters
And help my ship to set sail

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

When I'm downtown in Barcelona
When I'm pissed or when I'm pissed off
Mother Fist just gives me her tender kiss
And some of her sexy stuff
And I lock my door from the inside
Turn my mind to sweet sweet pain
And I wail just like Yma Sumac
Mother Fist she never complains

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

Now I don't care if I'm in a prison
In confinement solitary
A soldier lost in the legion
Or a sailor out on the sea
A beggar, thief or a rich man
A gunman mercenary
A one legged crook
An Armenian cook
As long as my mother's with me

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oppress the power that exists
Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oh the power that exists

In the land of freedom, I will make a clean
Forth rack on production [?] this is all insane
Heart of the heartland or they stream the blood
Where invisibly, for one thousand and third

Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oppress the power that exists
Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oh the power that exists

No alliance, sure no cross to bear
No crack to follow, no police to share
Apathetic revolution, people go put to sleep
As the people are wake up they'll be rioting the streets

Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oppress the power that exists
Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oh the power that exists

The wish you plead and the things you sought
We all think, we all thought
The things I've done, and the world I've seen
Don't measure up to my queen
Oh, I take one for the other, and work my way through this machine

God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh no
God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh

The first train out, the last one draws
We'll all sing, we're going home
As the curtain swings in to cover all our secrets kept, our love enough

God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh no
Oh girl, this is what I've become
And I'm going to leave it up to you
What are you going to do?

'Cause I don't want to lose your hold on me
'Cause I don't want to lose your hold on me

God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh no
God damn, this is what I've become
And I'm going to leave it up to you
What are you?
What are you?

Just remember
Pay no attention to this iron, this iron fist
Just remember
Pay no attention to this iron, this iron fist

God damn, this cursed
God damn, this cursed
God damn
God damn, this cursed
God damn, this cursed

Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here

You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose your track
Can't go on but you can't go back

Beast of evil devil's house
Tooth and claw they pull you down

Too many problems
Oh why am I here
I need to be me
'Cause you're all too clear
And I can see
There's something wrong with you
But what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely you got no one
You get your body in suspension
That's no problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you

Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want
Then you'll fade away
You won't find me working
Nine to five
It's too much fun a being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You won't find me living for the screen
Are you lonely all your needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do

Problem, problem

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you
Problem

I ain't equipment, I ain't automatic
You won't find me just staying static
Don't you give me any orders
For people like me
There is no order

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
I'll leave it to you
Problem, the problem is you
You got a problem
What you gonna do

They know a doctor
Gonna take you away
They take you away
And throw away the key
They don't want you
And they don't want me
You got a problem
The problem is you

Problems, problems, problems all day long
Will my problems work out right or wrong
My baby don't like anything I do-o-o
My teacher seems to feel the same way too

Worries, worries pile up on my head
Woe is me I should have stayed in bed
Can't get the car my marks ain't been so go-o-ood
My love life just ain't swingin' like it shou-ou-ould

Problems, problems, pro-o-o-o-blems
They're all on account-a my lovin' you like I do-o-o-o-o
Problems, problems, pro-o-o-o-blems
They won't be solved until I'm sure of you-o-ou
You can solve my problems with a love that's tru-you-e

Problems, problems, problems all day long

Problems, problems, problems all day long

Oh no the battle forms inside,
And I speak, but you don't see the signs,
My heart aches, leaving me here to hide,
My world shakes, until you assure me,

Oh no there goes composure,
Over and out to sea,
oh no this won't control me,
But it seems to get the best of me,

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder why...

Oh no I'm crossing my fingers,
In hopes that you will not leave me,
Far away, the silence it burns me,
As I wait, the tension builds,

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder why...

Oh why can't I move forward?
Oh why does my mind wander?
Oh why does my heart desire you?

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder...

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder oh why...

Oh no there goes composure...

You saying that you know
But I really really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boy
So don't be dumb
I got 99 problems
But you won't be one
Like what!

One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds

Pill cool but I prefer my MDMA by the bag
Heavy hitter right here, all you other nigga's jabs
Big talking bout beef till you serve they ass a slab
Do the math hoes clash, cause I got them yelling, "Woo!" like Flair

Now it's 442 my pack a bang rewinding,
My bitches red as highness throw back on them Yokohamas
I'ma slam the scraper, you touch the paper it's go,
We out here grindin' fo sho
These hoes thinking it's snow
I get it goin' my nig', I blow the horn as she ready
Disrespectful nigga please, I'm the one with the fetty

I just show 'em my diamonds nigga 'cause Lane is the game.

Out with the old.
And in with the new.
That's what they say,
Those who don't have a clue.

You're fighting this rain.
You're willing the shine.
You can't help yourself.
But I know you are trying.

When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict

Still chasing a dream
You're facing the facts
The weight of the reel
No more regrets
No looking back
The problem to big
The tower to high
Yes says the heart
But no says the mind

When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict

I wish this world apart
Where I could give you all the answers
But the fight continues on
And the fact of the matter
Is I am convinced we all
Spend far too much time on the fence
Choosing sides
Tell me which is right

You can't deal with the problem on the surface anymore
Go for the root -
And put your boot in the door
Knock down the walls

And get right to the core
Go for the root
Brush off the dust when you find it
Now's the time to explore

Go for the root
It's the conflict between fact and meaning
I'm living proof
And you can't scale the walls

'Cause there's an armed guard on the roof
Go for the root
Just found a crack in the foundations
We'll drill ourselves a way

Right to the root
Brush off the dust when you find it
Now's the time to explore
Go for the root

You can't deal with the problem on the surface anymore
Go for the root
It's the conflict between fact and meaning
I'm living proof

When you watch the starving thousands
On the channel of your choice my friend
You're an audience for war
But you're always switching sides

It's like looking at a landscape
Through a microscope in the middle of the night -
Even half a revolution
Would only bring you light

Go for the root
You're so messed up by politics lady
There's nothing exotic in poverty
Go for the root

Where do you get your information
From a dream or a twenty four inch screen
Brush off the dust when you find it
Now's the time to explore

Go for the root
You can't deal with the problem on the surface anymore
Go for the root

Conflict, confusion, distrust...
Conflict confusion distrust

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Confusion in my head
Don't understand all that you said
And now I see the light
It's times like these I realize
But how can I read these
Mixed messages that you did bring
And forgive all the pain you cause
All of the suffering

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Keep my perspective straight...
Keep me away from hate...
Keep my eyes uncovered...

You taught me right

I feel so deceived

Conflict, confusion, distrust...
Conflict confusion distrust

I feel so deceived!

Looking for an answer to end all the violence
But you'll find no solutions behind the white paper
Searching for a way to break down that fence
Do you really believe in this ludicrous caper?

Mountbatten murdered - a rebel gunman's been shot dead
"They're all murdering bastards" - or was that something that I read?
Well, whatever - it's just the same -death, destruction, violence and pain

This side, that side, that side, this side
What side? Any side. You can't side me
That side, this side, this side, that side
What side? Any side. You can't side me

Where could it end? What could the outcome be?
One thing's for sure there'll be a lot more corpses before the Government can see
A lot more screaming bullets. A lot more children dead
And a lot more 'Bloody Sundays' all painted in red

A lot more pointless talks and a lot more death walks
A whole lot more of whose tribe should rule
The squaddies on the corner. The gunman's on the roof
Who's the real terrorist? Well don't look to the media for your proof

The British Empire ain't what it used to be, mate!
And it's a bit late to try and make it great
So, what's the point in fighting out there?
British Constitution on a land's fate

The 'Vengill' computer sums it all up
It's just packed with reasons to cut people's lives up
Well whatever, it's just the same
Death, destruction, violence and pain

I see no point in deciding
Because I won't fight for troops in Ireland
I won't shoot the IRA dead
And I won't smash no bastard's head
Because I don't want to die
Do you want to die?

This side, that side, that side, this side
Right side, wrong side. Can't side me
This side, that side, that side, this side
What side? Your side. Can't side me

Nowhere to run, to hide
Justice, revenge for their crimes
bloodshed without warning
Now they must all pay the price
The ultimate in justice, reprisal for their crimes
Assassinate, eliminate, the rule of an eye for an eye

The moral question, to take another's life
Political necessity when justice has been denied
Terrorized for crimes that often go untried
Spreading fear throughout their victims, ultimate sacrifice
Criticized for killing any hope for peace
Violence no matter what the consequence

Who pays the price? all for a place that they call home
Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home
This pain, this suffering, in a fight that will never end
Withdraw, to disengage from a place that they call home
Reclaim, retaliate in a fight that will never end

Fighting for a home, the right to claim a land
when victory is everything and nothing will hold back
This is their fight to keep their home
This is their fight to claim their land
This is their fight to keep their culture and their people on the map
Someone must pay for their crimes

Attrition.
Kill their own kind.
Suicide.
Kill their own kind.
Attrition.
Kill their own kind.

And they will fight with everything for victory no matter what the price
They must defeat at any price
And they will fight with everything
Relentlessly, when justice is denied
The choice must be made
Kill. this price must be paid
Kill the choice must be made, kill
This price must be paid, kill
Revenge must be made, kill
For a place that they can call their home
And they will fight with everything until they've reached their goal
The price to pay for a place to call their home
To keep their culture and their people on the map
Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home

Something to prove, something to say
Feeling secure, a false portrait
Forging alone the facts unknown
Hiding the to drag us on

Trapping the standpoint
Local disjoint
More to protect than to reject
Reflect the conflict inside

Punish the core, the more unsure
Testing the strength of us once more
Peeling away the scar to bleed
Peeling again a growing seed

Accept the consequence
Unlike our differences

Shameless and painless
Reflect on conflict

Darkening the senses
Hate pounding on
All emotions conquered
No heart to be found

Nerves fill with fire
Open eyes dialate
Burning deep inside
Weakened bodies fulminate

The forward march
Is crushing life
Firepower
Lights up the night

Rip through the flesh
Searing within
Militant trek
Death only wins

Enemies must die
The only law
To push the line
This is the law

To take life
To crush life
To rule life

[Instrumental]

I want it all no question
Queens terrorism, at his best when I wear my vest and
Desert Eagle, inferred for protection
Interceptin, your collection, when I'm makin' section
Nigga listen, I brake ya ass into submission
Professionalist, specializin' in this
Hennessey wit a twist, another nigga miss
Gone in the abyss, fuckin wit the fish
Scratch him off the list
Automatic trey pound seven in my fist, get ya wig split
Green Eyes rise, Flushing, Queens, 'Lanz Enterprise
Wise got shine, forever brightly
Gats forever held tightly, this fight be (don't take us lightly)

Now stoned be the way Quaz' walk, reppin' New York
For outlinin' criminal bodies wit white chalk
Wildin' these streets, I'm playin' for keeps, avoidin the beast
To keep play the cemetery body, capisce
The hashish, made me unleash, six through his dome piece
And that's just to say the least
But quote for quote, more dough choke throats like inhale smoke
Forever ready like nine volt, batteries
Lost casualties, ricochet through ya anatomy
Another tragedy, wit my family cause catastrophe
From Queens them Kings call me ya majesty
Drama has to be, my hostile days, from outta, puff lies
These high roller somethin', before my shots'll start pumpin'

6-3 Thug, blow a nigga like drought
Some say my lifestyle, need to be change
Scramble and foul, two hundred ten pound
Take nickel plate, who hold the weight now
Leave you hear, bouncin the whip, I'm sippin' Cristal
All thunked out, bent in the streets wit my pistol
My rhyme noters, rippin' ya meat, for beef I hold it down
Fuckin' wit the wrong cat, to many gats black
Phenom never suffer set back, I blast off just like a jet pack
To crack the barrel, Pacino through over dowel
Just get a title, find ya life blazin' in the saddle
Knowin half the battle was just a Queens soldier story
And fuckin wit niggas unless you asset to all for me
Spotted the code, with five seconds to explode
Escape wit the scroll, my family gun ho
Five hundred mellows, crackin serafino
Ropin casinos, but seenin a man, wit gun totin, chico
That organize extortion like the Godfather sequel
To open eyes to all evils that peoples
Mainly maintain to do, shittin' where I'm through
Fuck's not given when I'm rippin through
Who is you? I can see fast and blast past ya faggot attitude

Off top, the Remi had me bent dizzy and shit
Drunk like a Mexican, clap wit ya Fam wit Smith and Wesson's
Rip, heavy wit shine, diamond flexin'
Spot lock for possession, welcome to the real world
Taught 'em why I hate this (We don't a fuck who it is)
Stop the bullshit, I guarantee you get hit, by Psycho Kiz
1996 to the year I quit, nothin happenin'
Fuck the yappin', and start clappin'
All these savages movin' backwards, splittin' they wigs
Smashin 'em, shootin 'em, red rum for everyone
Fuck a key, Queens niggas move in tons
The real number ones, for the chest, ice fish still on the run

My desert needs a high rise, fuckin' wit these wise guys
Can you recognize, Desert Storm, 'Lanz Enterprise
Smile like Einstein, jury drip, guns combine
You don't want mine, gotta fight this all in one time
Plus ya override, bustin straight, you bustin' the sky
I know you scared while I'm lookin' at the devil inside
Rollin dice like my weapon, hold the four and a five
And a cold and hard where I was born from the start
Here to play a part, smokin' weed and sellin' the dark
And watchin out for NARCS, Flush and entourage in charge
And surround the espionage, we all livin' large

How can we achieve anarchy if we don't know what it means?
Do we even want anarchy that illusionistic dream?
They say they see no reason for discontent
In this period of free enterprise, is evolution spent?

Say their progress is insallable, presented indisguised
Decisions made for all is their responsibility?
They forecast better ways to better days; onwards they seek progress no matter what it takes
From left to right to all the prats in the middle

From the judge to the preacher to the sinners and the cynical
From the Godley to the gullible to the vicious and viable
The globe turns slowly while the governed and ungovernable
Slay it out in the never ending search for righteousness, immaculate success

Their space to possess seems to be what makes their clock tick, but to us it fucking stinks
When met with resistance, they stamp on it until it breaks
Their society remains secret and although we know their name
We are the pawns on the world?s chessboard in one big multi-national game

There's still no end in sight but still we know we?re right
We must somehow struggle on up while they go racing to the top
Then Whitehouse "V" the squat, a challenge I think not
Resist every move they make by fulfilling our own hearts

Not by backing off and dropping out, get in there for a start
If you're looking for some proof of this how much more proof do you need
When constantly and hopelessly we fail and they succeed
There's no compassion in here

My fingers keep curling into fists these days
No one smiles on the streets these days
And there's no compassion
Hit the wall a substitute for a face

You can look but you can't touch
You can see but you can't have
Keep crawling to the end of the week
And there's no compassion

Breath heavy to pretend it?s fun
Raise the cover to protect your pride
Ignore the failure that you see in the glass
Paint the flesh to hide the scar

And there's no compassion
A million people died in the middle of your breakfast
A million people died in the middle of your favorite love song
A million people died in the middle of your racist joke

A million people died in the middle of your favorite TV programme
A million people died in the middle of your lovemaking
A million people died in the middle of your pop stars interview
A million people died in the middle of your video game

A million people died in the middle of your sexist
A million people died in the middle of your mass debating
A million people died in the middle of your politicians lying
A million people died in the middle of your silence

A million people died in the middle of your stocks and shares
A million people died in the middle of your royal variety performance
A million people died in the middle of your debutante?s ball
A million people died in the middle of your day out at Ascot

A million people died in the middle of a Conflict gig!
Separation is complete. A mind to domesticate, condition, compete
Clinical birth control, the sterlised setting
Syringed into being, life is just beginning

Mask of the surgeon, eyes of the blind, rubber band caressing, welcome to mankind
The brain perceives the fear, tender beats the heart
Slapped into life programming starts
Wanted and needed

Wanted from birth to fit in the jigsaw puzzle
Trained don't strain against the muzzle
Force-fed, prostituted, brainwashed that's called learning
Blindfolded, prejudiced, an outcome predetermined

Needed to die and not question why
Follow in ignorance, a comfortable prison
Kept in the dark so they can be free. Spit in the eyes so you will never see
The kid aims the cap gun, points it at my cranium

I am supposed to put my hands up, but I don't want to die that way
Mentally or physically, para-psychologically, whose responsibility?
Is it to feed their profiteering tolerated as long as your mind is fearing?
Right where they want you beaten back into submission

Right where they want you in a missionary position
Needed to promote their glory of possession
To accept and be grateful yet ask no questions
To believe in love and their guiding hand

To obey in humility and never understand
I was feeling alright, yeah just me and the night; I was walking through a white tiled subway
I heard the sound of voices around the corner shouting
The sound of broken glass, no one was there

I looked at my reflection in the puddles in the street
It looked so messed up I just kept moving my feet
To the beat and rhythm of my heart, not much I know but I see it as a start
Because I'm counting the heads to see how many are left, the fingers of one hand stretching

And this feeling of apathy keeps coming quite suddenly -
Well if something?s gonna come, when's it coming?
While you're jumping on the spot, all the freshness starts to rot
And another inspiration fades away. And still you sell your dignity

Still you sell your dignity time after time
And I wonder where lies your pride, does it wait in there inside?
Is it waiting for the moment when you let your heart speak?
Is it waiting for the moment when you act out your own beliefs?

Is it waiting for the moment when you drop your false act?
Is it waiting for the moment when you face the facts?
That you're pumping your life for someone else?s ideas
That you're living your life under someone else?s fear

That it's time to shift your vision, time to move your head
Get up out of submission. I'm counting heads, how many are left?
The fingers of one hand keep stretching. The fingers of both hands keep stretching
And all I see is "Rock ?n? Roll". All I hear is "Rock ?n? Roll"

I turn the pages of the book, and force my weary eyes to look
At the product of our modern world, at the product of our civilised world
And a child?s face looks out at me, questioning why does this have to be?
And I can't find any answer, not that dead ears can hear - do I make myself clear?

It's been said that we must progress for humanity, but looking at the truth of that mockery
I wonder if our minds have progressed anywhere, and I wonder if there's any humanity there
The sightless eyes looking at me, questioning why does this have to be
And I can't find any answers not that dead ears can hear - do I make myself clear?

If you're an activist not while getting pissed,
If you're gonna do something make sure you don't miss
That's a dangerous game to play what use are you if you're banged up?
You can't beat them on the streets, so duck and dive a little, hide the fiddles

Play them at their own game, stay with them all the way
Know what and why they are doing things and create alternatives
Police are still snooping, awaiting the big nick
Like fishermen baiting the fish, tempting us to take the risk

This time, this time they've made the impossible.
The new aids infection from EMI the treatment to replace the old spermicide

The poll tax hangs above our heads, as Thatcher wields the axe
The budget, well that pleased us, our shares increased and less tax
The nurses, fight for better pay ILEA closing down
Alton hits out with his bill, the yuppies invade town

The AIDS creation raised its head, their latest weapon to date
USA battles it out in the Gulf to show only they shall reign
The IRA bomb a military base some injured, someone dead
Superpowers discuss Atomic bombs, reductions seem in sight

Thousands join the new clause and march for Lesbian and Gay rights
The TUC, they delegate, another disaster strikes
P & O put their foot down, airport chaos screws the break
Sunshine radiation homes in; down pours more acid rain

See it ain't no pretty picture as we see our world destroyed
Multi-corporation graphs rise up to keep us all employed

The Government say they're succeeding with their democratic state
They say that we all stand as equals
That they genuinely trying, but the bastards are lying
Spewing out their bullshit, simply talking out their arse
The opposition prove yet again that they're just a jumped up farce
Full of socialist Marxist bollocks that just don't make any sense
Barking totally up the wrong tree on the wrong side of the fence

The only change you will see from them is the silver handed back
As you buy their militant paper full of promise and attack
A more apt title would be "servant" for their lapdogs just the same
As the racist shitrag bulldog, politricks the game

Support this, support that you don't know where support is at
It ain't dishing out little leaflets, wearing badges, looking right
They march here, march there, showing all how much they care
Lining someone else's pockets as the bucket comes around again

If you don't vote, then don't complain - oh fuck off!

Don't you realise what you're saying?
You're supporting every move they make
Holding the parliamentary system up, they rise, the powerful elite
There is no independence in party politics

They police the street, they dictate the beat
Her Majesty's institutions make sure the aware retreat
Oh yes, it's a sad sickening picture of human nature going wrong
Plummeting down the depths of degradation, the end, the result of your votes. We stand
Alone... Stop

Start- by organising, putting small pieces together
Soon the bits will fit in place the start of our new picture
Push forward for what you believe in and on achievement dig in hard
Don't let them try and break you, without you they fall apart

Civil rights and natural force will conquer, all and it's right on course
They can only offer chaos when the least we have got is love
We're talking one long tough struggle with many set backs along the path
To freedoms now ahead of us our world will exist at last

Remember, against all odds

We offer you democracy and progress. If you have the capital, we can offer you interest
There is no poverty, this is our reality. We will protect you but only if you invest
The AIDS crisis comes to those who sin,
You question the Gulf situation but the right shall win

Subversive groups are minorities. Will they ever learn and see?
That we're superpowers, we will always sin
Support has grown for the mutant sexual acts. Allow us please to give you some hard facts
We shall not stand for deviancy; it's not the way God meant us to be
Normal people we must push them back

So Listen crowd of people and listen wisely, it's I, daddy Kerry, telling everybody
So what we gonna do about this mad lady?
Everybody knows she's gonna mash up the country
We must be patient in our struggle for freedom

The state shall make it's own mistake, don't feed them ammunition
Time is not running out, time be with us on our side
Maintain the resistance; see the end of apartheid
We're living in a Government style. No time for no fuss and fight, everybody must unite.

We must abolish apartheid
Brothers and sisters fear no more! Rise up and face this evil oppression
Sigh and cry no more, for one day, that fine day
The huge cloud that overshadows all. Shall lift, rise high, all say - forward

Don't shake the hands of the firing squad. There are no tokens here
Remember those burning eyes, them hungry bellies. No cure can exist in promises
Medicine cures all, but when cancer spreads, there can be no cure
Meanwhile brothers crawl on the death pile to die. The result of western world economics

Meanwhile the bullet rips the flesh of the young mother.
The flies feast on the eyes of the young child
Meanwhile - hey cool guy McDonald's man, eating the flesh of the fellow man
Wise up, sucking up to the good life. The Coca-Cola formula continues to run red

Rising high on the graph of oppression
Public outcry exists worldwide. Headstones still commemorate the many who have died
Coffins laid to earth. Resistance dead. Rowntree Mackintosh machine guns rise instead
Crucify jah children; suffer once again they shall

In honor, they retaliate. Stones against tanks, inevitably the innocent die
The bodies laying deep are your responsibility
How can sister from outside nation march in disgust at apartheid, whilst using dictator bankbook?
Finance fuels all and in retrospect, it offers nothing more than misery

Political leaders stand off, offering the false hand of opinion poll support
Political factions offer nothing more than violence
Ignorance breeds arrogance, arrogance creates violence. And that is their solution
The abysmal result of dictatorship. Their excuses for slavery

The chain around our necks. The guns in the street
don't consider violence as an alternative
Until you've picked up bits of your relatives in the street
Until you've felt the whip crack tear the skin. The gas burns the eyes

The baton on the skull. The torture in prison
Use sanctions and the grey cloud will disperse
The constitution known as apartheid and it?s ilk will be destroyed
And our world shall exist

Brothers and sisters
Such things cannot be bought and sold
Such things cannot be arranged by Governments
Such things cannot evolve overnight. These things take time
These things take time

When I'm lost
Can't find my way
You're the light that leads to harbor

When I'm crushed can't find my strength
You are all elements of life
Giving me skin so warm so tender
Giving me deep a sense of believe

All I know, all there is
A reflection of you
A home to this body of conflict

Deep into my love
Deep into my heart
Deep into surrender

When I'm blocked
Can't find my words
You're the lines
Making a sentence
When I'm hurt
Can't find the sense
You're the sun
That heals all sorrow
All I know, all there is
A reflection of you
A home to this body of conflict

Deep into my love
Deep into my heart
Deep into surrender

This is mankind and mankind kills
You think that women are just here for thrills
Your filthy morals just fucking stink
Don't try and get my hands in your sink
Don't call me your "bird"; I'm not your pet
Well, I've had enough, right up to my neck

This is mankind and mankind kills
Why should women be raped at your will?
This is mankind and mankind kills
Why should women pay for man's thrills?

Why don't you get married?
Wear that wedding ring?
Can't she see it's the only respectable thing?
She'll cook his meals
Sleep in his bed
Do anything he says

If only I had known you better.
If only you weren't afraid to try.
You and me, we'd make a bad, bad team.
But we'll never understand the reasons why.

If only you.
If only me.
If only you.
If only me.

I remember the day that I met you.
The politics were already strong.
I think you knew, like me, that it would never work out.
And I'm surprised that it even lasted so long.

If only you.
If only me.
If only you.
If only me.

If only light didn't come in the morning.
If only darkness didn't fall at night.
If only you and me had led different lives, baby.
I know that eveything would have turned out alright.

If only you.
If only me.
If only you.
If only me.

You've got to believe there's something inside of me
That makes me feel this way
You've got to believe that you're still a part of me
Today

But telling a tale cannot be like living it
No matter what you say
And talking of love cannot be like giving it
Away

I know
And you know
The voices are calling
Now that I have you

Whatever in the world can I do
Now that I have you
Whoever in the world could say it's not true
Now that I have you

I wonder how much of our life is memory
Remember yesterday
I'm hoping to God you don't believe everything
I say

Remebering every part of our history
A year is like a day
You've got to believe that things won't always be
This way

I know
And you know
The voices are calling
The walls are falling
For my love
And your love
I've got to keep stalling
Now that I have you

Whatever in the world can I do
Now that I have you
Whoever in the world could say it's untrue
Now that I have you

Well, there's a hot wind blowing tonight in the east,
And I heard that the park is filled tonight with police.
On the radio there's nothing but a man saying
To stay inside.
Well, I remember what you said on the telephone,
That you didn't feel like it was safe to stay alone.
And you would get yourself to me if you could find
A way across the line.

But there's fire tonight on your side of town,
Orange light in the sky without a sound.
Fire tonight on your side of town.
I watch and wait for you to come around.

Well, there's a faint sound of sirens tonight in the air,
And I heard that the downtown streets tonight are bare.
On the TV here they're telling me the roads are all
Closed down.
You said that if you couldn't take the car you'd walk
Instead.
It was the last thing you said before the line went dead.
And now I'm waiting by the window holding all the things
Of yours I've found.

But there's fire tonight on your side of town,
Orange light in the sky without a sound.
Fire tonight on your side of town.
I watch and wait for you to come around.

I know we always said that we were free.
I know we never thought this would succeed.
But now your face is all that I can see.

But there's fire tonight on your side of town,
Orange light in the sky without a sound.
Fire tonight on your side of town.
I watch and wait for you to come around.

Here are a few notes from the underground.
Load them at your pleasure.
These are the dusty pictures that I found
While on my search for treasure.

Here is the hazy vision that I saw,
For a scientist I am too raw
I know all about you can't you see?

She said don't be making no provocation
Unless you're ready to handle the nation
I'm cold and I'm bold and I don't do what I'm told.

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

Remember as you bust north at her call,
That you can never doubt it.
No matter what you cannot have it all,
'cause she leaves home without it.

But in the darkness where we both were caught,
In the heartbeat of El Nido.
I had a vhs for her to slot
And now I never want to go.

She said "Now you're here, you've got to show and prove,
And do that dance until it don't move.
The phone doesn't work so you won't be calling home."

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

She was so absolutely digital,
To jack in now was wrong.
But Cupid punches deck with chemicals
While Dark Madonna sings her song.

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

Mirrorshades.

He got a sheath made of plastic
Grabs it over his head
Forty gallons of petrol
Gonna burn you all dead

A forty-five strapped to his side
A machete in his hand
What's the name what's the game
Holy hack jack's the man

He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
He hobbles along on a busted knee
Knife strapped to his thigh
Bombs and blades, hand grenades
Somebody's gonna die

With his cassocks an' his robes and his leather chaps
Covered by a plastic mack
He's sick he's insane
Holy hack jack's at it again
Sick sick, sick sick

Clapped out buggy down darkened streets
Likes to kill whoever he meets
He's sick he's insane
Holy hack jack's at it again
Sick sick, sick sick

He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
Sick sick, sick sick

The worms crawl in and the worms crawl out
The ones that crawl in are lean and thin
The ones that crawl out are fat and stout
Your eyes fall in and your teeth fall out
Your brains come tumbling down your snout

Be merry my friends
Be merry

You don't know how it feels to be Me
To be sitting on the edge dangling my feet
Wondering if god would give his angels charge
If I was feeling small
If my mind was growing large

I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head

You don't know how it feels to be Me
Having all these faces looking in to see
Their eyes are white lit just like a torch
To burn my soul which is thin and which is worn

I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head

Take my life
Take my life
Take my life
Before I taken it myself

You don't know how it feels to be me
To be a poet nailed to this tree
Where are my accusers those who ridicule
Those who have learned to hate and curse this silly fool

I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head

I know headaches are always
Someplace on my mind

But your drug
Just make it worse, love
Little pains are just fine

Sometimes, medicine works well
Chemicals help out, for sure

But your drug
Just make it worse, love
The treatment's worse than the cure

But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned

As long as the sun's in the heavens
The worm stays underground
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned

All bonds that God ties
Man is master to tear apart
All crop on God's made land
Man is master to sow and reap
All deaths worms die
Man is master to engineer
And the bliss of freedom glimmers like gold
Empty the cast, melt the mold

The worms of God

We've torn away Your spear God
This is sacrament to show it
It's the bread of liberation
And the wine of celebration
In the gloom of gluttony, lust takes its toll
Its hold is stronger than of the Gods of old

The worms of God

Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far

Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me you'd stop and see
How beautiful they are

Inch worm, inch worm

Life sucks
And death is calling
Every day

I keep my chin up
But my spirit's falling
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

Last night
Won't see the morning
Every day
I see the sunset as an endless warning
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

Knife cuts
Through all that I wanted
Every day

It's like living in a
House that's haunted
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

...and all is well in our world

He wears his heart
Safety pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers
Whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of whats inside
To save his life he crawls
Like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird

Out of his mind away
Pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
Maybe out of his mind

All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of whats inside
To save his life he
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm from a bird

All he knows
If he can't relieve it it grows
And so it goes
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from the bird

Out of his mind away
Pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind

All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of whats inside
To save his life
He crawls like a worm from a bird
All alone he
Holding his breath half to death
Terrified to save his life
He crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

Worms don't dance they haven't got the balls
No matter how do you do
It's just you do that's all
You got what it takes to knock at my door
You wanna get all excited
Never been here before

And now I'm your apple eating heathen
The original sin
Well you ain't got my faith
So best keep your belief
I had waited forever to love someone
I swear I heard you thank your god this time
For having me come along

Chickens don't fly but they have got the wings
No matter how hard they try
They bump into things
They're all running around
Like they're heads on the ground
They got a wish bone where their backbone should've grown

And now I'm your apple eating heathen
Any old rib stealing eve
Well you don't have my faith
So best keep your belief
I had waited forever to love someone
I swear I heard you thank your god that time
For having me come along

Intimacy reduced to cruelty
Had you believe like this was meant to be
And I look for the magic
But you got away with it
That's all

Everyday I reach down into the dirt
Hoping to find me a little nugget of gold
But all I got is some worms
Everyday I pull green slime down to my heart
Grab it with both hands and hold until my lungs burn
I think tragedy sleeps at the foot of my bed
Its incessant breathing keeps me awake
Every time I wake up it takes me at least 10 minutes to remember my name
And sometimes I get it wrong
Every time I reach out into the world hoping to find a kindred soul I get burned
Burn it down
I've been searching for a reason I've been living for the season
Give me something to believe in
Burn it down

Crack! What the feins use to get high
And the hustlers move to get by that's why the song called crack!

I got the cops drawn, I put the block on
Over rare 'bout to stock piles of the popcorn
Feins got the block warm getting they cop on
My young'ns run the block till ev'ry one of the rocks gone
And I got another block I'm puttin' the pot on
Strong enough to smell through the jar wit the top on
Cop and be gone, if you come to the block drawn
I'll hit you with the glock till ev'ry one of the shots gone
He thought he was a thug he was all on his pop join'
Till he got popped now he all on his rock join'
I left him all on the block wit his top gone
Law called his mom and pop they all on they shock join'
I was just tryna make some bread for my family
And ev'rybody got somebody dead in they family
And ev'rybody got some crackheads in they family
So it's no room to hate cause I kno you relate, my shit

Crack! Crack! Crack!
Its called crack!
I said crack!
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!

Falling around in a fog of a mountain
It took me away
And now ill never go back
Always believed you
But never could see you
You seemed to disappear when
Everything went black
You turn around one minute
And they've taken everything you have

Look at the night the skies the seas
The trees the cracks running up the wall
Think of the start the end the screams
The dreams the thing underneath it all

Day, it is ending no calling no sending its harder to remember just who you are
Waiting for someone to come follow you into the dark

Where did it go? storm of love.
Thunder of flesh, hurricane of blood.
Hail of sweat. the cleansing rain
Used to come lick their pain.
Fingers search the private space.
Promise fills your face.
Treasure chest, beautiful back,
Kiss every crack.
Sit around the fame.
Crack
Slowly I became.
Crack
I'll do it, I'll do
Anything you tell me to.
Stick it on or stick it through.
Anything you want me to.
Any ship, put through
Any port I'm coming to
Anything you tell me to...
Where did it go? storm of love.
Thunder of flesh, hurricane of blood.
Hail of sweat. the cleansing rain
Used to come lick their pain.
Sit around the fame.
Crack
Slowly I became.
Crack
Fingers search the private space.
Promise fills your face.
Treasure chest, beautiful back,
Kiss, kiss every crack.
Kiss, kiss every crack.

Get no regard for no br'noad
Peel'noff my car, bitch I'm from Collipi'nark
Southside, outside, and I'm ridin' round, I get it
And I look around, they took my style
Like mothafucka you trippin'
Let me slow it down 'fore I get a ticket
Nigga want a verse from me, it's gon' cost a chicken
Rev your mirror, shake it like a stipper ho!
Car so big it got a stripper pole

All I talk is crack, I can get the Ricoh

[Chorus]

And you need to mind your fucking bi'naz
Get cash, get fat this will pay for tonight
New car, you are not me forget it!
I got more hoes than four hoes
I had a foursome for Christmas!
Let me turn it down my baby mama listening
Extra garlic butter I got benihana issues
Trigga finger itchin' like it's poison ivy
Going so hard Viagra trying to sign me
I might get an endorsement from baking soda
Catch me cooking crack trying to make a Rollie!

[Chorus]

Crack

All I talk is crack, I can get the Ricoh!

Don't stop singing; it's a beautiful sound
I'll get the drinks in before we hit the ground
And I don't know who'll speak first
It doesn't matter anyway tonight
Let's be best strangers
They closed the bar an hour ago
Last train whistles down the track
But I see something growing up from the cracks

I'll show you my heart if you'll show me yours
Were you wild and unique babe or just par for the course?
What have we got to lose, anyway?
From one drunk to another think what I'm trying to say
Some mirrors have been broken
And some things pull you back
But I see something growing up from the cracks

We've both seen the thunder that's coming in low
And each day tries to run you right off the road
But if you listen out for the sound
We'll get a thousand hooves drumming in this one horse town, and
The lights are out on the west side
They paint the sky in black
I swear I see something shining up from the crack

And they closed this bar an hour ago
Last train whistles down the track
But I see something growing up from the crack

I thought you'd listen to my reason
But now I see you don't hear a thing
Got to make you see how it's got to be
Yes if it's all right

All or nothing yeah yeah
All or nothing
All or nothing for me

Things could work out just like I want them to
If I could have the other half of you
That's all I would if I only could
Is to say

All or nothing oh yeah
All or nothing if I could I'd say
All or nothing for me

Pa pa pa pa ta pa pa pa ta ta
Pa pa pa pa ta pa pa pa ta ta

I ain't telling you no lie girl
So don't just sit there and cry girl
All or nothing (oh no)
All or nothing (oh yeah)
All or nothing (gotta gotta gotta keep on tryin')
All or nothing
(For me, for me, for me we're not children)

I she'd my skin
When the party was about to begin
I'm light years away but
I'm walking back, tonight,
Of all nights
When I should be feeling just right
Don't want to be in public,
My head is full of chopstick I don't like it.

Something on my mind..
Breaking open doors I sealed up before,
Something on my mind..
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far.


Somebody shaking my tree
Maybe that somebody is me
I'm standing in the light but I'm making a break for
The shadows on the cinema wall.
They should be mine but I'm not that tall
Now I'm saying this in private
If I had a car,
I'd drive it insane

(chorus) (chorus)


I'm looking for cracks in the pavement...

(chorus) (chorus) (chorus)

Got into a cab, Broadway, Fifty Ninth
 Took off like a blast
Almost lost my mind - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack

It first felt like at thrill ride
Excited for a while
Got pretty scary
Swerving at a hundred miles an hour - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack
I want to get out,
out of this yellow shell
I want to get out,
crack cabbies straight from hell

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack

Cabbies on crack
Want my money back
Disco blasting out,
Stomach in my mouth - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack

Times Square was approaching
He braked for the light
At 90 miles an hour,
flashed by, I saw my life - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack
I want to get out,
out of this yellow shell
I want to get out,
crack cabbies straight from hell

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack

Cabbies on crack

We've had enough of you
And your do as we say not as we do
Where the hell do you get off
Thinking your better than us
Who are you to make the rules
The same rules you always abuse
Your someone we'll never trust
We'll respect you when you respect us

We will thrive while were alive
Nobody's going to bring us down
We'll bend but never break
You can't take us
You can't make us quit
Never falter Never Fail
We've got the will to fight
The future is ours to take
You can't break us
You can't make us

Cracks in this armor hard to find
Search all you want but your wasting your time
No weak link No Achilles heel
Just a burn we'll make you feel
Formed from ire and angst
A deep resentment coming of age
Don't look now but here it comes
The revolution has now begun

There is nothing you can say or do
We'll anticipate your every move
You can do or you can die just stay out of the way
If you must try to fuck with us than you know this now
We will make you pay

OK, kick me in the head
Just cause something that I said
You don't want to know the truth
Cause you're wild and full of youth

Was it something that I said
Something that I said
Something in my head?

You ain't got no friends no more
Cause you kicked them to the floor
Time will tell, and you will see
That it's down to you, not me

Was it something that I said
Something that I said
Something in my head?

OK, now you're on your own
Your self-righteousness has grown
So get off your pedestal
Before you ain't got no friends no more

Was it something that I said
Something that I said
Something in my head?

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the
Gonna lock us up in a, home
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Am and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman
Ta being a president look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music you make when you round that
Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?

That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music

Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it

Oh come all you children
Don't grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman

Don't whore your little bodies
To the worms of paradise
Like Everest, it's fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice

They're riding on the subways
They're riding on the streets
They'll ride you down to the gutters
They'll ride you off your feet

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

Yeah, piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and Coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
The pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
And they'll ride you down to Hell

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth, it sticks like glue

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire

To take your little body
And throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

I'm riding on the subway
The subway down to Hell
I've finished with this journey
Now, I seem to know it well

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock

You're shuckin' and jivin'
Stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock crack rock crack rock

Crooked cop dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot
300 men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the sound

Don't no one hear the rounds, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high

Crack rock
Crack rock
Crack rock
How you feeling girl
How's the gutter doing
Crack rock

By and by, you knew that you make me cry. (By and by, knew you'd make me cry)
And my love for you will never die. (My love will never, never die)
But I had to find out on my own.

(Check yourself, check yourself)

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I paid no mind. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself)
All down the line. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Sometimes you just got to lose.
That's when you pay your dues.
I guess I was a fool, I guess I was a fool,
To think that... you'd stayed so true.

Aww, I really played in the game. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'd always win. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Now the tables turn. (Check yourself, check yourself)
And I'm on the losing end. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Oh don't, feel sorry.
I had it coming, it's true.
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you.

Before I go, I'd like for you to know.
You've had my heart from the very start.
But there's one more thing, before we part.
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart.

Aww, I'm on my sad way. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Because I know I'd lost your love. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'll kick it, like a pass. (Check yourself, check yourself)

But I'll be thinking of....
The good times. (The good times)
The bad times. (The bad times)
But good or bad, happy or sad,
Of memories. (Memories)
Sweet, sweet memories. (Memories)
Aww, memories... are all I have.

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they... what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)

I know I'm sick and my addiction got me itchin'
Everyday I need a fixin'
I ain't quittin' till it kill me
Ya hear me, I like the feel but hate the taste of the product
Like the numb on ya' tongue when you taste narcotics
The bass gets to bumpin'
You can feel what I'm drummin'
Death is comin', I'm tryna warn 'em
That's why I was summoned
I know that they don't want it, they want what they can't have
Euphoria come and go and it's something you can't grab
Still, we're grasping for the emptiness, hoping we can catch something
Hand full of scars, cuts, burns, and some flesh wounds
Verge of insanity, stop me 'for I'm gone
Yeah, I say I'm gon' quit but I'm back at it in the morn'
It goes on and on and on and now I'm used to it
It's a lifestyle now and I don't know what else to do
Got a war inside my soul and it's wantin' to break through
I'm ready for Rehab, jus' do what ya gon' do, Yea

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab

(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab

Tell me what you're gonna do
I know that you know that I'm on
To you
I see your game and I see
The way
With my self esteem you love
To play
When I'm feeling fine things
Go alright
You're sure to be right by
My side
But when I'm down I look around
You're nowhere to be found
Here they come again
Will this ever end
Around till I need them
My plastic friends
They melt when heat begins
They're walking mannequins
My plastic friends
I wonder if you'll ever see
Exactly what you've done to me
I feel alone I've been attacked
And you put the knife into
My back
What I need is honesty
Open exchange from you to me
I've come to you my
Pride aside
So we can make this right
Three times denied I've
Relied too long on visions
Capsules of elastic
Mental prisons
Relating to the masses
For thirty pieces
Candy coated personality thin
Like reece's
Synthetic figments artificial
Pigments
[pathetic] ingesting poisons
Of facades
Illusions on a mountain high
Like Colorado
Bravado London bridges they
Be falling
Value of fools gold with
Kisses manifested
Break, smash, shatter
Counterfeit flatter
Imitation of a friend 'cause
The heat makes you scatter
Blending, comprehending but
Still deceiving
Aimless inventions creations
Spiritual manipulations
I'm running out of patience
Fascinated in your attempts
At being plastic
Spastic, kind of drastic my
Companion you are not

In this world of make believe
My eyes see what I want to see
I'm blinded with the simple lies
So easily I justify

The sin that comes so naturally
Is this all that I'll ever be
Bring this madness to an end
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride
I think I've had enough

Spinning 'round, up and down
But I know it's alright
Move ahead, falling back
Try to leave it behind

Seems I've been here before
So familiar I can tell
Need your help to get off
Of my sin carousel

It's suffice to say I move
Because of your great fortitude
So unstable are my feet
They love to make a fool of me

Afraid to fall I feel corrupt
And as I drop, you pick me up
Take me were I've never been
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride

Pullin' down strongholds
Pullin' down strongholds

Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires
Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires

I got my feet dirty 'cause I'm splashing in the puddles
Got me crazy no room for rebuttals
I let down my guard like doug I got lazy
Hazy vision blurry in a hurry for immoral satisfaction

My heated passion desires, I shoulda put out the fires
That smolder in my mind, time after time, time after time
Will you help me God to just find my own way

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires

Actual facts keep the theories intact
Mental premonitions speaking flesh to rest
I will not go, I will not bow
Shapes and silhouettes making things complex

Unleashing chemicals give my body a sign
A loss of control leads to moral regret
Seduction, repercussion where I must defend
Entering in the trinity within to fight sin

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen to you
As a result of making these rebellations?

Inventive measures taken I feel my defenses breaking
Independent of all wisdom, secondary senses shaken
In time I arrive battered, beaten and scarred
Sensitivity charred from character barred

So hard to say goodbye to yesterday's dreamin'
Still pullin' weeds from seeds of yesterday's schemin'
Elusive representation of putting mercy to test
Confessed in midnight sessions of my desires suppressed

Entangled similes I've been meaning to comprehend
Conformed by the ways wearing dark shades
Covering up my vulnerability
You can see, I can see this lust is tempting me
To break the chains to avoid devastation, I pray for strength daily

Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires

Co-existing remedial rhymes
 with verbal signs
Disseminating inner visions
 to contrive
Broken pieces cobblestones
 they pull me down
Redirection for protection
 confessing
Animosity when your voice
 grows faint
Submission at your feet they
 feel the stings of complaint
Doing what it takes I'm
 taking table crumbs
Dependence on the one
 popularity is done
Expedient the main
 ingredient as I grasp
For the hands of providence
 to circumvent attacks
From the enemy though they
 come against me
Will I listen to your voice
 to infinity
Speak to me 'cause I long for
 your grace
Show me things as I seek
 your face
Here I am I'll do anything
Say want you want from me
A contradiction in my
 directions got me guessing
Do you listen? not to
 mention my phones off the
 hook look
I took control of
 my own path disregarded
 your wrath
Stinky like a day without a
 bath but
Internal convictions oppose
 my addictions
To inventions less eternal
 paternal
Affection from elevated places
 smiling faces
Whisper love in aimless spaces
I hear your voice won't you
 let me follow
Knees bent so we can shoot
 the breeze signs I
 can swallow
Keep the lines open like
 fiber optic hot like
 the tropic
If your driving this train
 let me hop it
Say what you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you speak to me
Wha do you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you
 speak to me

Take time, what's on your mind?
Everybody's standing on another side
It's a chance for personal gain
If you're gonna play on someone else's shame

Take time, share another life
Perfect to the end and taking on our strife
Take the time to clear up your mind
Put away yourself and open up your eyes

This time, I started waiting for myself to fade
Walking in to complications and I rearrange
Do I fear my feelings, am I numb to pain?
Are my senses washing me sane, will it ever go away?

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading

So come on it's about time
Love is so blind, you're walking on the line
Set your mind on ease, take a turn for me please
Would you please?

If you sit back, look at your life
Look at yourself and set back your pride
Take the time for what's on your mind
Put away yourself and open up your life

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Today I want to get away
I want to go some place where I can pray and
Go where the trees are tall
Where the water rushes to the falls

Fly, I want to fly away to a place where they can't find me
I, I want to see the stars that shine and I'll land on mars
And run, I want to run all day far away where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter place

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do

Today I want to get away
Where the skies are clear most every day
I'll go where the river runs
Washes away my field of pain

Fly, I want to fly up high let my spirit soar I'll kiss the sky
I want to go to the place where I find you
Run, I want to run all day to a place where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter day

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away

An urgent sense of regret and now I'm caught in the zone
My mind arrested by fear and so I go it alone
A metamorphosis conceived by the early light
Distraction of self comes out in the night

Fabricated, I'm constructed of opinions and lies
Which only leads to failing in my own eyes
Sinking to the depths while I'm masking what's inside
A bittersweet existence and I cause my own demise

And I wonder if you've ever seen life through
The eyes of one who understands what it mean
To be free, freedom comes when you can let it go
But I guess you wouldn't know

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Mind reflects the meaning to things that are jumbled
Resting on the first, making time to rehearse
Intricate persona, controlled animation
Visually impaired, clinging to pain immersed

Mentally scarred, cosmetics dripping down
Life in forward motion, exist in reverse
Instable at the seams, trying to conform
Trapped in a maze while sin is at its worst

And I wonder what your gonna do, when your
Disguise comes crashing down and yourself
Comes shining through, are you gonna hide your face?
Or let it rest in the hands of grace, grace

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade
Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade

Dimensions of intervention
Are needless so I think
Striving and thriving I see
I'm driving to the brink

Avoiding annoying eternal
Complications destinations
Unimportant constantly
Distorting my relations

From patience to thoughts of
Hating anyone in my mind
I find it hard to believe you
Can relate to my kind

And if I could I would
Pretend that I'm alright by myself
If you love me as I am I'll
Put my pride on the shelf

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
Skepticism leaves a wrinkle on my brow
Cynicism prevents my change
With this suspicion I'm caught in a dilemma

Intervention with my psyche?
Rearrange walls built to hinder
The intrusion
Preservation of my mental well being

Doubt makes me value the
Safety of my distance
Can it be stubbornness to
Which I cling?

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
And if I climb a wall of pride
Swim across my sea of doubt
Will you love me as I am, the way I am

I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose its like forgetting,
Losing who you are,
And at the same time,
Something makes you whole,
Its like that there's a music,
Playing in your ear,
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry,
It's a bit like being scared,
Confused and all mixed up,
And mad as hell,
It's like when you've been crying,
And you're empty, and you're full,
I don't know what it is,
It's hard to tell,

Its like that there's some music,
Playing in your ear,
But the music,
Is impossible,
Impossible to hear,

But then I feel it move me,
Like a burning deep inside,
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

Then suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh oh whoa.
I'm free.

Ooh

I'm an artist honey
You'll see me sometimes
Making crazy pictures out of music and rhymes
Costume changes perform with poise
Dancing in formation with a couple of boys
I take them on the road with my reel-to-reels
I'm an artist honey
You know how that feels?
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes
It's about wonder
The power to be like thunder
Expressing electricity
It's the greatest show with the best effects

Call it performance call it art
I call it disaster if the tapes don't start
I've put all my live into live lip-sync
I'm an artist honey
You gonna get me a drink?
It's the greatest show with the best effects

The Minus is loveless
He talks to the land
And the leaves fall
And the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, Plus
She don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

The masking tape tangles
It's sticky and black
And the copper
Proud headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges
That don't get charged back
Well the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy
And she holds out her flashlight
And she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her
What the trouble might be
Well I'm learning
It's peaceful
With a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown
Of this century
They're not going to fix it up
Too easy

We once loved-together
And we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded
And the sparks started flying
And the loose wires
Were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up
Too easy
But she holds out her candle
And she shines it in
And she begs him to show her
How to fix it again
While the song that he sang her
To soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits
Like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

I'm burning through
When I am near you
I feel such a rush
Need it so much from you
And now,
I'm so isolated cause,
You give me it all
Then take it I fall
Without you

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

And now, I'm so isolated cause
I'm sick with no touch
I miss so much
Can't be with you now
It's much too much
Without you
Without you

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

I'm running here
Every focus is splintered
Every attempt he can afford
Rendered pointless and it's streaming down
Senses together they move cleaner than transit will allow
And sometimes I want to move cleaner than transit will allow to be

Electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity

Now in between
Leaving and arriving
I can try to digest this sequence of events
Again I draw it out
And again I get delayed reaction
I get splinters
I watch the people and their cars
It's slow motion
They're beautiful like breaking glass
Not yet broken
My motion is silver on the point
Of a moment, splinter, moment
My vision, the colour of

Electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity

Moment, splinter, moment
Splinter into colour
And let me be

Electricity
Electricity

Singin through you to me
Thunderbolts caught easily
Shouts the truth peacefully
Electricity

High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow deed
Go into bright find the light and know that friends don't mind just how you grow

Midnight cowboy stained in black reads dark roads without a map
To free selectricity (repeat) (Repeat both lines)

Lighthouse beacon straight ahead straight ahead across black seas to bring
Seeking electricity

High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow-deed hide their shadow-deed (repeat)
Seek electricity
Electricity

This song started as a rant against haters
But that'd be giving in to the instigators
If there is one thing I'd like to pull off
When someone steps with hate, all I do is scoff
You can't burn me, you can't burn me

[Chorus]
The same force that flows through every circuit
The juice that's spent every time you work it
Every life form is based on this simplicity
The soul that you have is electricity
You can't avoid that
Evolution is fact
We're all from the same Lucy
Despite differences you see

I'm in disbelief at what people will believe
All along, I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve
If one thing I can say as a piece of advice
Don't believe it till you see it, and then see it twice
It's so funny, it's so funny

[Chorus]

A call out for unity
In every province and city
What do you think we've been saying
Since we first started playing

Freezing Fridays fleeing from me
I've seen you around, I don't know what you think of me
The colors in the air never scared you like they should
I saw it in your face so I told you and you understood

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

Sustained means some Sunday so are we
People speak all week, I just forgot what they told me
The stories in your hair that you carry are it for me
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to lay in it

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

The stories in your hair I've been carrying all around
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna hear 'em now
The stories in your hair I've been carrying all around
Well I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna tear it out

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna stay at your side on a weekday
I wanna see inside your eyes on a weekend

I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travelers to go?

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there, then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly

We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give

We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night i get a call and i know that you're well
And days i was down you would help me get out of my hole

Ohh
Let's be friends
Let's be friends
Let's be friends

You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair

We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

And I can be proud that I'm his girl
'Cause I know that I'm good all by myself
See I don't need his love
I really want him, right

And he can feel good that he's my guy
'Cause he knows
It don't mean that he's just mine
I don't wanna own him, or control him
I just want our souls to be aligned

So,
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
He picked up for a walk around,
He's gonna put that down again

I'm the one he loves & trusts
He goes out on the town
I don't get jealous
It's all about affection
Not possession with us

And I do exactly what I want
When I'm with him,
And when I'm not
It's not a maneuvering
Just to deal with
What we've got

So, If you love someone
Let them be free
I know I don't want no one suffocating me.

Don't settle for ownership
Make it deep
If you love some one
You should feel good
To let them breathe

So,
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around
I'm his
When you see me walking around
I'm his
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

A friend is someone you like to be with
A friend is someone who likes to be with you
And big or small, short or tall
It don't matter at all to a friend

A friend is someone who stands beside you
When others are treating you mean
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And are you a friend?
Do you think you'd make a good one?
'Cause you've got to be fair
And show them you care
'Cause a best friend is someone who knows how to share

A friend is someone who makes you happy
A friend is someone you make happy too
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And are you a friend?
Do you think you'd make a good one?
'Cause you've got to be fair
And show them you care
'Cause a best friend is someone who knows how to share

A friend is someone who makes you happy
A friend is someone you make happy too
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And big or small, short or tall
It don't matter at all to a friend

I likes to eat my friends and make no bones about it
I likes to eat my friends, I couldn't do without it
Ain't a man or poet, friend, I know just how you'll taste
Your limbs go sliding down my throat and never go to waste

Your death, of course, will sadden me, until I drop your essence
I know your life was not in vain when digestion is commencing
Consider this a celebration and the deepest pact of friends
And I hope that you will dine on me when I come to an end

(Friends, friends)
Even friends may come to you with a new found revelation
But think of it as life renewed and not their termination
"To know you is to eat you" should be the code of lovers
Death brings the highest act of love preserved for one another

(Friends, friends)
People say that what you are is only what you eat
And my friends become a part of me, it's then that life's complete
To know you is to eat you, the act of love supreme
Each one of us inside himself can appetize the dream

(Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends)

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

Sometimes, there's no one to talk to
No one else I can find
But He's always there, He's everywhere
I'm talkin' 'bout a friend of mine

Problems seem like they never end
You have no one to turn to
But you can lean on Him
He'll never let you fall and
All you got to do is call Him
He's just a friend

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

It seems so crazy
You see times have changed and
People say they treat you so good
But then they smile in your face and
They talk behind your back
They're not like the friends of old

But I found a friend who's love is true
It won't change no matter what happens
He's gonna be right there
And you can depend on Him

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

And if you ever need a friend
He's always by your side

And He'll never, ever let you down
He's a friend of mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Yes He is

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your jobs a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,
Or even your year
But

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

You're still in bed at ten
And work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast
So far
Things are goin' great

Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought
You down to your knees and

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Since you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the mess with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst I'm best with you, yeah

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,
Or even your year

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to fall
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

Packing up the dreams God planted
In the fertile soil of you
Can't believe the hopes He's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through

It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

With the faith and love God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show
But we'll keep you close as always

To live as friends
No, a lifetime's not too long

I dreamt of a move
A great move
To another place with much more land
I was driven by car
And woke before I got there
I remember the place and it was beautiful

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.
As friends we were always so close but so far away...
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend?
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for.

There was more for me
It would be more open
Scary to think that I could be happy
She'd said it was the same road
But up more, a lot more
Just be patient and we'll get there

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.
As friends we were always so close but so far away...
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend?
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for.

I never got there
But the morning brings light
And so, I'll keep on looking.

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.

Trying to figure out where and when
We been moving down that same line
Time is now maybe we could get skin to skin

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slippin' a-way
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

I know we're different you and me
Got a different way of walkin'
The time has come to let the past be history
Yeah if we could just start talkin'

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good things got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good things got a way of slippin'
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

Do, do do doo do do do doo
Do, do do doo do do do do doo
Do, do do doo do do do doo
Let's be friends
Do, do do doo do do do doo
Do, do do doo do do do doo
Let's be friends

There's a lot of talk going 'round you
Let them talk you know you're the only one
There's a lot of walls need tearing down
Together we could take them down one by one

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slippin'
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends

When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

*Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends
 Ones we can depend on
 Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends
 Before we go any further, let's be
 Friends*

You say you and your girlfriend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies

You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

And now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

*Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends
 Before we go any further, lets be
 Friends*

 How many of us have them?

Friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving God
And they're precious beyond human evaluation
But you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke
And the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless nights
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
Somewhere where nothing much ever happens
But a few of my friends are big people
They'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court
They're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words
And yet they're no more precious in God's eyes or in mine
Than those wonderful nobody's who live and die in small towns
Who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement and concern
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
The most important thing they have in common is their ability
To share with you your most sky splitting joys
Or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends

I want to know
What you feel inside
Is something wrong
Why did you leave last night
Is it all just a game
Oh, tell me why we can't be lovers

I do believe
In the two of us
That you and me
We are the only ones
And we were meant to be true
So, tell me why we can't be lovers

How could I be such a fool
I thought I already knew it all, but I know
I was totally wrong

Listen to your heartbeat
It will take you higher
Follow your emotions
I know you'll get stronger

Listen to your heartbeat
Your feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion
I know it's inside you

How will I know
If you're fooling me
Maybe I'm wrong
But it seems, to be like
it's all just a game
And I just want us to be lovers

We had it all in our hands
Just like those all happy ends
I still don't know why
But we lost it somehow

One more chance to make a try
Nothing left to do for you and I

Listen to your heartbeat

Walking on the moon
People at the bottom of the sea
People in tombs

People in igloos
Even a tribe of pygmies

People are the main spring
Turning the world around
People, they're the main spring
Spinning this world upside down

People sun people toast
People tire shile other people smoke
People bowl people rock
People pay to see two people box

Dress me baby me
Phone me wire me
House me bug me fire me

It's a chilly Florentine evening
Two men in evening hats
Telling tales of the underground and
fishing for Reds
Policemen armed with Uzis
stand guard but they don't speak
Ain't seen no Michaeangelo
he'll be here next week.
The girl in the shoes
with the crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother
They raise a glass of amber wine
take pictures of each other
of the policemen in the fountains
and the sickle and the hammer
and they came with Uncle Romulus
with his walking cane and camera
She looked like someone's girlfriend
she looked like a dream
she looked as unlikely
as the people's limousine.

Come and sit by me, girl, before I breathe the breath out of you
Hush your mouth and cover your eyes for I'll tell your father of you
He paid to have you painted in the company of angels
Only to find you flirting anew with Chico Marx and perverted Engels

The patron saint of television smiles down from the shelf
Romulus can't criticize but he can't bless himself
He has a tin of pea-green paint and a big roll of black tape
To vandalize these obscenities then make his escape

She walked up to the nice policeman and asked him for a match
He saw Romulus approaching and slipped off the safety catch
Then cut down her uncle, he was painted red and green
Just as she was kidnapped in the people's limousine.

featuring The Fugees




The wickedest combination in the world!






[Pras]

Walk around in the record industry

I'm looking at all the Pharasees

Asking me where I'm going

All I know is one day that Babylon will be fallen

They welcome me into Jerusalem

Eighty niggas highly crucial by Ham

I got my .45 by my side

Just in case another nigga tests me someone's gonna die



[Wyclef Jean]

Bo bo so bo I leave the boat for the pope

Smoke mad weed but not touch Bayley Coke

Primary purpose of the set

Is to present techniques and guided practice

And forced access to forfeit

Emcees lose focus

Wyclef to accomplish throwing crumbs in the hell pit

Vocabulary, comprehension, steady reading and critical analyzing

Techniques to enable DJ's to interact with my material

Play it on your turntable scratch it if you're able

Characteristics, circumstances

Will determine how long you live Mr. actor, Mrs. actress



[Pras]

I act will snatch gats from kids with packed back black raps

In an Ac to get with that









[Wise Intelligent]

Black people say I represent when I get my chance

But when I'm rippin' to this beat, yo it's my nubian dance

That I be doing

Around these suckers' titles that I ruin

Although you do not like the flow you should not have been booing

Now you and your crew had better get your act together

Before I have to cut the fool release the stormy weather

Whatever you say, but nigga pop your shit my way

And you'll be screaming "Mercy me" like if your name was Marvin Gaye

Now put it away and stay the fuck up out my face

I smack you in the mouth homeboy and you'll be missing taste

What a waste to everything existing up till now

So many claiming butter but just don't be knowing how









[Pras]

For sure I'm law to be the poor righteous conscious

You might just feel thrust when I touch like Midas

My toungue is gigantic, lyrics are tremendous

Wyclef and Pras they drop hits wherever they goes like Gladys

Catch the midnight train to Georgia

As my tongue does a dropkick like Sgt. Slaughter

New world order, you lions who are trying to roar

I'll silence you lambs like Jodie Foster

There's no need to feel sentimental

Parental guidance is advised for those who despise

The Wise and Intelligent, Refugees, immigrants









[Wise Intelligent]

May...I... kick a little something for the G-O-D's in the J-E-are-S-E-why

Because you niggas know me I'm the da gan ya dee

Sixteen five four three five coincide freak wise

Time you recognize who run up in the nine

Rush like water raw cuts in your guts

Trails from Rozelle oh hell we rock bells

Live as Stuyvesant, Wise and them, rise again

The Gods A.V.G. they'll bomb Washin-

No man 'em trouble they jet something

Don't make me have to kick you on your God damned chin

I'll frappe you in your head with bottle of Heinekein

La

Mister Wise



[Lauryn Hill]

OK, ha

My intellect will protect what you threaten

Captain to Lieutenant, even take cadets in

I take them all rich and to the powerful

Don't fear no other force I be defining your hardcore

The folklore you spread down over tracks

Got you gassed off some shit may I suggest Ex-Lax

Relax! Your whole perception seems to be distorted

In my dimensions fake refugees get deported

Jokers be biting each other's styles so much it's eerie

So many deja vu's but can't no other crews come near me

It's weary, my brothers couldn't hold this if they grasped it

Confession to Jesus are even tried to master

I passed it off the levels of your mere mathematics

I'm on some astrophysics Quantum Leaping on your tactics

Triple bypasses, your crew's slow as molasses

While I amass cream like Jackie Kennedy Onassis



Ah ah ah ah

Refugee P.R.T. connect

New Jersey, this is how we do it




The righteous would never live and the righteous would never die

Poor Righteous teachers and Refugees come to testify

We world sexy style

Yo

Allies, fire in the sky
Splinters in the eye, don't know any better.
Keep your, arsenal at bay,
Live another day, pull yourself together.
Every, war you want to win,
There's nothing to defend, nothing to surrender.
I don't, want to fight alone,
No one does.

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy.
Somehow, this war is out if control,
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes.

Nice try, cross enemy lines,
Look out for the mines, buried in the mirror.
Fall out, target on the move,
Coming into view, coming in clearer.
By now, no one else around,
Narrowing it down, guess I got to figure.
One war, is all I can afford,
No more.

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy.
Somehow, this war is out if control,
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes.

Here we go
Wasting lives one way or another
Here we go
Vacant eyes rearranging their color

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy.
Somehow, this war is out if control,
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes.

Here we go
Wasting lives one way or another
Here we go
Vacant eyes rearranging their color

Wasting lives one way or another

I saw a friend of mine the other day,
He said, "I love you, but I just can't stay,"
Lord, he seemed so very far away,
In his eyes I saw a look that I could not ignore, a look I'd seen so many times before,
God, he keeps on coming back for more; one more try.

When you're hurt,
When you scream,
There's a hope, there's a dream.

Harmony, harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,
We all need sweet harmony.

A paid attendant at a filling station,
A cherished member of the united nation,
A woman crying out of desperation; can't they see?
And there's a loneliness deep inside,
The kind of feeling that you just can't hide,
Don't you know I'll be there by your side?
You can count on me.

When you're hurt,
When you scream,
There's a hope, there's a dream.

Harmony, harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,
We all need sweet harmony, oh.

When you're hurt,
When you scream,
There's a hope, there's a dream.

Harmony, harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,

featuring The Fugees




The wickedest combination in the world!






[Pras]

Walk around in the record industry

I'm looking at all the Pharasees

Asking me where I'm going

All I know is one day that Babylon will be fallen

They welcome me into Jerusalem

Eighty niggas highly crucial by Ham

I got my .45 by my side

Just in case another nigga tests me someone's gonna die



[Wyclef Jean]

Bo bo so bo I leave the boat for the pope

Smoke mad weed but not touch Bayley Coke

Primary purpose of the set

Is to present techniques and guided practice

And forced access to forfeit

Emcees lose focus

Wyclef to accomplish throwing crumbs in the hell pit

Vocabulary, comprehension, steady reading and critical analyzing

Techniques to enable DJ's to interact with my material

Play it on your turntable scratch it if you're able

Characteristics, circumstances

Will determine how long you live Mr. actor, Mrs. actress



[Pras]

I act will snatch gats from kids with packed back black raps

In an Ac to get with that









[Wise Intelligent]

Black people say I represent when I get my chance

But when I'm rippin' to this beat, yo it's my nubian dance

That I be doing

Around these suckers' titles that I ruin

Although you do not like the flow you should not have been booing

Now you and your crew had better get your act together

Before I have to cut the fool release the stormy weather

Whatever you say, but nigga pop your shit my way

And you'll be screaming "Mercy me" like if your name was Marvin Gaye

Now put it away and stay the fuck up out my face

I smack you in the mouth homeboy and you'll be missing taste

What a waste to everything existing up till now

So many claiming butter but just don't be knowing how









[Pras]

For sure I'm law to be the poor righteous conscious

You might just feel thrust when I touch like Midas

My toungue is gigantic, lyrics are tremendous

Wyclef and Pras they drop hits wherever they goes like Gladys

Catch the midnight train to Georgia

As my tongue does a dropkick like Sgt. Slaughter

New world order, you lions who are trying to roar

I'll silence you lambs like Jodie Foster

There's no need to feel sentimental

Parental guidance is advised for those who despise

The Wise and Intelligent, Refugees, immigrants









[Wise Intelligent]

May...I... kick a little something for the G-O-D's in the J-E-are-S-E-why

Because you niggas know me I'm the da gan ya dee

Sixteen five four three five coincide freak wise

Time you recognize who run up in the nine

Rush like water raw cuts in your guts

Trails from Rozelle oh hell we rock bells

Live as Stuyvesant, Wise and them, rise again

The Gods A.V.G. they'll bomb Washin-

No man 'em trouble they jet something

Don't make me have to kick you on your God damned chin

I'll frappe you in your head with bottle of Heinekein

La

Mister Wise



[Lauryn Hill]

OK, ha

My intellect will protect what you threaten

Captain to Lieutenant, even take cadets in

I take them all rich and to the powerful

Don't fear no other force I be defining your hardcore

The folklore you spread down over tracks

Got you gassed off some shit may I suggest Ex-Lax

Relax! Your whole perception seems to be distorted

In my dimensions fake refugees get deported

Jokers be biting each other's styles so much it's eerie

So many deja vu's but can't no other crews come near me

It's weary, my brothers couldn't hold this if they grasped it

Confession to Jesus are even tried to master

I passed it off the levels of your mere mathematics

I'm on some astrophysics Quantum Leaping on your tactics

Triple bypasses, your crew's slow as molasses

While I amass cream like Jackie Kennedy Onassis



Ah ah ah ah

Refugee P.R.T. connect

New Jersey, this is how we do it




The righteous would never live and the righteous would never die

Poor Righteous teachers and Refugees come to testify

We world sexy style

Yo

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly,
Blackbird fly
Into the light
Of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Can you stop your instincts
Can you man your thought control, sir?
Will you give the last command
Or lie to a good soldier

I'm a doubter
I'm a fool
Let me be
All that I am

[Chorus]
I am not so sure
What you want me for
Either your machine
Is a fool, or me

Now there is no time to wait
No time to think it over
Take the path, believe the math
You'll tell me when it's over

I'm a fighter
I've a question
Won't you answer me?

I have earned the right to know
And tell you what I see

[Chorus]

We're all on our own
Look at us all
How can we not raise
A voice
Against the madness

There isn't the time
To worry or wait
'Cause only the young
Can carry the weight
And face the silence

[Chorus]
Do we run
Do we stop

Do we lie down?
I think not
There is an answer
That we've got
We are not helpless

The vision will stand
As blindness will fall
Now we must look
For the light
In the darkness

[Chorus]

Do we lie down?
I think not
There is an answer
That we've got
We are not helpless

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around the dirty town
And the children let out from their schools

I was standing on a noisy corner
I was waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
He was playin' real good for free

Me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and about thirty-seven criminal
Escorting me to this halls

And I'll play if you have some money
Or if you're a friend to me
But that one-man band by the quick lunch stand
He was just playin' real good for free

Nobody, I say nobody, nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew they had never seen him on their TV screen
So they passed his music by

Me I meant to go over ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signals changed
He was still playin' real good for free

Without you...
Without you...
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
If I could relive my life
I know what I would change
All the times I made you cry
All my thoughts that caused you pain.
I know "I'm sorry" is not big enough
To tell you how wrong I've been
But I don't know where to start
To live my life without you...
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
Without you...
Without you...
As the days go passing by
My feelings stay the same
I have you always on my mind
I'm living constantly in pain
I know I really should be moving on
But the memories won't go away
I have you always in my heart
And when I close my eyes I find you.
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.

You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.

Without you...

Holding you could be so easy
I can feel your arms around me
Holding you holding you loving you

I can feel your arms around me
Holding you holding you loving you
Holding you could be so easy

Give me a job give me security
Give me a chance to survive
I'm just a poor soul in the unemployment line
My God I'm hardly alive

My mother 'n father, my wife and my friends
You've seen them laugh in my face
But I've got the power and I've got the will
I'm not a charity case

I'll take those long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my eye on the keyhole
If it takes all that to be just what I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Make me an offer that I can't refuse
Make me respectable man
This is my last time in the unemployment line
So like it or not

I'll take those long night, impossible odds
Keeping my back to the wall
If it takes all night to be just who I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Keeping my mind on a better life
Where happiness is only a heartbeat away
Paradise can it be all I heard it was
I close my eyes and maybe I'm already there
(repeat chorus)

You see the world through your cynical eyes
You're a troubled young man I can tell
You've got it all in the palm of your hand
But your hand's wet with sweat and your head needs a rest

And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it
Why must you be such an angry young man
When your future looks quite bright to me
How can there be such a sinister plan
That could hide such a lamb, such a caring young man

You're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat and you know it
Come on, let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it

You're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat and you know it
Come on, let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it

Oh Mama I'm in fear for my life
From the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running
And I'm so far from my home
Oh mama I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

This jig is up the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
This will be the end today of the wanted man

Oh mama I've been years on the lam
And had a high price on my head
Lawman said get him dead or alive
Now it's for sure he'll see me dead

Oh mama I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

This jig is up the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
The judge will have revenge today
On the wanted man

Welcome to the Grand illusion
Come on in and see what's happening
Pay the price, get your tickets for the show
The stage is set, the band starts playing
Suddenly your heart is pounding
Wishing secretly you were a star.

But don't be fooled by the radio
The TV or the magazines
They show you photographs of how your life should be
But they're just someone else's fantasy
So if you think your life is complete confusion
Because you never win the game
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same.
We're all the same

So if you think your life is complete confusion
Because your neighbors got it made
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same.
We're all the same

America spells competition, join us in our blind ambition
Get yourself a brand new motor car
Someday soon we'll stop to ponder what on Earth's this spell we're under
We made the grade and still we wonder who the hell we are

I've got a hot chilly feeling I don't understand.
I've got to run through this minute like a hurricane.
I've got to tighten my wire from the sense to the soul.
I find my back to the wall when it's time to go.
I've got to know is that your heartbeat?

Paint...me right.
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.

I get a love shock/electric from the touch of your hand.
I'm getting lost in the riddles of the modern man.
I've got it up down all around tied to the bone.
Hey there's a strange situation on the late night show.
I've got to know is that your heartbeat?

Paint...me right.
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.
Do it right, I can feel the woman in me tonight.
Oh I, I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.

Paint!

Paint!

Collide a clause, unremitting can you cram?

I know you're dumb as paint.

Take your brush and gently dip it
Be careful not to drip it
Wet paint
( background singing cows "wet paint,wet paint")

Wet your roller then you roll it
Calmly cooly you control it
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint)

Red and green and yellow too
Purple pink and baby blue
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

You pour it in a bucket
You mush it all around
You take a mop and mop it
Oh you slather it and slop it
But be careful not to drop it
On the cold cold ground

Wet paint, wet paint
Wet paint, wet paint

Drippy, lumpy, gushy, gloppy
Smeary, smelly, slippy, sloppy
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

Squishy, squashy, muddy, mushy
Sticky, slimy, slurpy, slushy
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

Smear it, roll it, throw it, brush it
Squish it, splash it, crunch and crush it
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

You pour it in a bucket
You mush it all around
You take a mop and mop it
Oh you slather it and slop it
But be careful not to drop it
On the cold cold ground

Wet paint, wet paint
You know I'm crazy 'bout wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )
Can't get enough of wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

Won't you let me walk you home from school
Won't you let me meet you by the pool
Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the band
And I'll take you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
Won't you tell your dad to get off my back
Tell him what we said 'bout paint it black
Rock'n roll is here to stay
Come inside now - its ok
And I'll shake you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If its no then I can go
If its yes then let me know
I won't make you
Ooh ooh oh oooh

You come in while I'm sitting at the mirror
You want to say you know that I look nice
I sit in desperate silence and I listen
And with a cutting eye,you know you'd better look twice

''cause I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
And before you say it looks great
You'd better look again

Red is for the anger that you put me through
And for all those nights I felt alone,will see a shade of blue
I'll add a dash of yellow for the power that you've been
And the black will be your night ahead
And my shadow in your bed
I'm putting on my war paint

There's nothing you can say to make it better
And there's no apology to change my mind
I guess I could have sent a "Dear John" letter
But it's written on my face,it's war paint time

''cause I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
And before you say it looks great
You'd better look again

I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
I'm putting on my (War Paint)
Red is for the anger that you put me through

I heard the notes all fade away
Leaving memorial stones
Yesterday's thoughts have come to stay
Until they decompose
A picture paints a thousand words
With nothing much to say
What last night seemed had to be heard
Is left unsaid today
So when you said you understood
I couldn't understand
I was looking at an empty beach
As you saw all the grains of sand
I was counting views from windows
When you looked in from outside
The light was blurred and distant
And several cities wide
So I turn up the volume
To hear the notes so dim
You said you couldn't hear it
So I asked you to come in
Then you held up a mirror
And I saw my face congeal
I was thin and getting thinner
And I dreamt for real

Paint a rumour
(What's it gonna spread?)
Paint a rumour
(See the place go red)

I could tell you something
(Promise not to tell)
I could tell you something
(Promise not to sell)

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

I have heard a whisper
I have heard a whisper
(What did it say?)
I heard a whisper
(Make it go away)

Don't believe a word of it
(Promise not to tell)
Don't repeat a word of it
(Promise not to sell)

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's my secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

Paint a rumour
Paint a rumour
(See the place go red)

I could tell you something
I could tell you something

Suddenly before my eyes
Hues of indigo arise
With them how my spirit sighs
Paint the sky with stars

Only night will ever know
Why the heavens never show
All the dreams there are to know
Paint the sky with stars

Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly?
As the heavens seem so far now,
Who will paint the midnight star?

Night has brought to those who sleep
Only dreams they cannot keep
I have legends in the deep
Paint the sky with stars

Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly?
As the heavens seem so far now,
Who will paint the midnight star?

Place a name upon the night
One to set your heart alight
And to make the darkness bright
Paint the sky with stars.





Girl before the mirror
Appraises her disguise
Child become a mother
Tries to fix her eyes
No more of his excuses
It has to be today
She can keep her fantasy
If she can get away

Paint her name on a one-way street
Painted cheeks with angry heat
Wounded pride on painted eyes
Paint the night with battle cries

All puffed up with vanity
We see what we want to see
To the beautiful and the wise
The mirror always lies

Boy before the mirror
Checks his camouflage
Polishes his armor
And the charger in the garage
No more lame excuses
It has to be tonight
He can take the princess
If he can take the fight

Pound the drums with martial beat
Pound the streets with marching feet
Wounded pride, distorted eyes
Paint the night with battle cries

All puffed up with vanity
We see what we want to see
To the powerful and the wise
The mirror always lies

Boys and girls together
Mistake conceit for pride
Ambition for illusion
Dreams for self-delusion
Girls and boys together
See what it is we lack
Boys and girls together
Let's paint the mirror black
Paint it black

Run my finger
Down the window
Paint a picture
It is so cold

Lonely in Idaho
Turn on late night blue light,
Hotels, early flights,
I don't know

Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
For the good

Oh on the eastern shore
The ocean was all I came for
I'll tune your old guitar
Dig a pony, water, mason jar,
It's "anything you want"

I can hear you whistling
while you're getting your dresses made
Getting lost under the summers by the lake
If we decide to go

Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
Everything
Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is, everything is

In the distant sea, you could be my queen
Float away on a bumble bee
In my dream, the castle on King somehow flies away

Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
Everything
Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is, everything is





I see a red door
and I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day

I look inside myself and
See my heart is black
I see my red door
And must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun,
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

I see a red door
and I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

(Humming)

I want to see it painted
painted black, black as night
black as coal
I want to see the sun
blotted out from the sky
I want to see it painted painted
painted, Painted Black
YEAH!

(Humming)

Face to face, but miles away
Building trenches out of empty spaces
Lay here, next to me
And close the distance in between

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're tryna hide
Take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake
Of our war paint

Scar to scar, I wanna know
Every story that you never told
Don't shut me out, don't think too much
Don't keep that barricade up

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're tryna hide
Take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake
Of our war paint

So hold me close and kiss my skin
Don't be afraid, let me in
I'll hold you close and take your hand
To my heart, here I am, yeah (Oh)
Oh

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake ('Cause we could be beautiful)
Of our war paint

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint (Without our war paint)
And we could have it all once we let our walls break (We could have it all)
Our walls break (We could have it all)
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line? (The front line)
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake
Of our war paint, our war paint

Tell me the tales that to me were so dear
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Sing me the songs I delighted to hear
Long, long ago, long ago

Now you are come all my grief is removed
Let me forget for how long you have roved
Let me believe that you love as you loved
Long, long ago, long ago

Do you remember the path where we met
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Ah yes, you told me you ne'er forget
Long, long ago, long ago

Then, to all others, my smile you preferred
Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word
Still my heart treasures the praises I heard
Long, long ago, long ago

There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the breath of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long

I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand
And for the cause of Christ
I have spent my days believing

What He'd have me be is who I am
As I've come see the weaker side of me
I've realized his grace is what I need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

For God so loved the world that He sent His Son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge to set us free
Oh, but deep within our hearts
There is still a war that rages

And makes the sacrifice so hard to see
As midnight fell on crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away
And as evil tried to stop redemption's flow

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

And now when Heaven looks at me
It's through the blood of Jesus
Reminding me of one day long ago

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

They were young and they were free
There were twelve men who believed
In a man who asked them to leave
It all behind and follow me

So they set out on this journey
Not knowing where He would lead
But soon they would see clearly
What the price would have to be

That day would come
When they would choose to live or give their lives away
They could have run
But with their final breath Heaven heard them say

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

We don't see Him with our eyes
Can't touch the scars that are on His side
Still we feel Him in our souls
And now we know that He's alive

And our message is the same
As the twelve who made the way
With a faith that God will live inside
Of those who call His name

The day has come
To lose ourselves and give our lives away
All for the One
Who's in our hearts, we raise our hands

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

I believe, I believe in the promise
Of a life that no man can steal away
I believe, I believe we'll all see Jesus
And we'll worship Him forever

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark

Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves

Driving down the highway
It jumped out and caught my eye
Painted there in neon green
Well, it couldn't be denied

Just two simple words
On that bridge for all to see
The answer for a lonely world
How easy could it be?

Complicated living needs a complicated cure
At least that's what I've heard
But suddenly what I believe gripped the very heart of me
As simple as it seems, nothing says it better than

Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
There's nothing more that I can say
It's just enough that Jesus saves

There's a man in Southern Haiti
Who's got a call to reach the lost
He's schooled in his theology
And all the meanings of the cross

He sees a world that's dying
Knows the one thing left to say
Is wrapped up in two simple words
That are never gonna change

I think it's time we put aside
Things that only cloud the mind
It's enough to speak the truth
Take a look, you will see, what it is that sets us free
As simple as it seems, nothing says it better than

Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
There's nothing more that I can say
It's just enough that Jesus saves

He came for the lost and the hurting
Oh and He died for the broken souls
And He lived for the ones who are searching
We've gotta let 'em know

Jesus, I know that Jesus
Jesus, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus, I know that Jesus
Yeah, yeah, Jesus, I know that Jesus saves

Jesus, I know that Jesus
Yeah, yeah, Jesus, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus, I know that Jesus
Yeah, yeah, Jesus, I know that Jesus saves

He saved me, He forgave me
Yes, Jesus saves that's just enough
He saved me, He forgave me
Yes, Jesus saves it's just enough

Yes, Jesus saves, yes, Jesus saves
Yes, Jesus saves, it's just enough
I know He saves, I know He saves
I know He saves, I know He saves me

I know, I know, I know He saves
I know He picked me up
He turned me around
He placed my feet on the [Incomprehensible]

[Chorus]
Well may the world go,
The world go, the world go,
Well may the world go,
When I'm far away.

Well may the skiers turn,
The swimmers churn, the lovers burn
Peace, may the generals learn
When I'm far away.

[Chorus]

Sweet may the fiddle sound
The banjo play the old hoe down
Dancers swing round and round
When I'm far away.

[Chorus]

Fresh may the breezes blow
Clear may the streams flow
Blue above, green below
When I'm far away.

[Chorus]

The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me

Take one fresh and tender kiss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Add one stolen night of bliss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
One girl, one boy; some grief, some joy
(I was rover, but now it's over
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Memories are made of this

Your lips and mine, two sips of wine

Memories are made of this
(I was rover, but now it's over
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor, stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays These are the dreams you will savor
With His blessings from above
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Serve it generously with love
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
One man, one wife, on love through life

Little airports keep in mind
They got file folders and dry-erase boards
I retired from the air force
Long enough ago to know

The sky is open

I call the tower and draw the line
I'm flying, yes I'm climbing
A better pilot couldn't find
Even so, even I can only fly so high

The sky is open

In the war I flew the islands
I knew the quiet, it's pilot science
My propeller tries to find the air
I'm finally the highest bird

The sky is open

Student why do you dream of me
When you dream of your acre of trees
It was agreed
I came to burn leaves
It's all I ever claimed to do
A plow man I'll never grow into

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh

Blue in the broad light of day
Your claws are snagged on my face
Say it, I wish we were naked and
I wish that I could take it
When you turn on me

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh I don't want my words twisted
I don't want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope that I can keep seeing you
As long you as you don't say you're falling in love

Crave translates into slave
No one can harness the rain
And I can make myself into rain
You'll feel me on your cheek
And on your sleeve

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh I don't want my words twisted
I don't want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope I can keep seeing you
As long as you don't say you're falling in love
But I can feel you about to forget
Yes I can feel you about to forget

It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street





Out where the creek turn shallow and sandy
And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars
When the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops
Straight into my arms
Straight into my arms

I'm ridin' hard carryin' a cache of roses
A fresh map that I made
Now I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul
And dance on it's grave
And dance on it's grave

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here

Well my daddy he was just a stranger
Lived in a hotel downtown
Well when I was a kid he was just somebody
Somebody I'd see around
Somebody I'd see around

Well now down below and pullin' on my shirt
Yeah I got some kids of my own
Well if I had one wish for you in this god forsaken world, kid
It'd be that your mistakes will be your own
That your sins will be your own

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here

(Whoaaa)

Out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia*
Where the sword of Orion sweeps
It's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires
And you breathin' in your sleep
And you breathin' in your sleep

Well there's just a spark of a campfire left burnin'
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside
Reach 'neath your shirt, put my hands across your belly and feel
Another one kickin' inside
And I ain't gonna fuck it up this time

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here

(Whoaaa)

I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;

When you're smiling, When you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

When you're smiling, When you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.

"Clang, clang, clang" went the trolley
"Ding, ding, ding" went the bell
"Zing, zing, zing" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell

"Chug, chug, chug" went the motor
"Bump, bump, bump" went the brake
"Thump, thump, thump" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

"Buzz, buzz, buzz" went the buzzer
"Plop, plop, plop" went the wheels
"Stop, stop, stop" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line

I came back on the trail of a man
Things are the same as when I left
Well I so wanted to say hey
But I know you think my sentence was too light
Now time should have put this behind us
Some things I won't soon forget
Bride and bridle are too close in a man's mind
And I know you think my sentence was too light

You, you weren't true
But I can't blame a woman who changes
Three thousand, six hundred and fifty-odd days I waited
Time, I did my time

Now I long since quit feeling my hands
Still, three men have a date with me
I could have found them all before now
And I know they think my sentence was too light
Your father bet ten years against this day
He wed his girl to a better man
But he stands here now with his hat in his hands
And I know he thinks my sentence was too light

I know I wasn't made to play on a team
You weighed your suitcase down but it still wouldn't sink
I know that crime doesn't pay
But I don't know any other way

the way that she smiles me down
She claims to be clowning
I finally long for someone
Teaspoon

two can just bleed into one
But only one does the bleeding
She calls me the alphabet gun
Teaspoon

I know I wasn't made to play on a team
You weighed your suitcase down but it still wouldn't sink
I know that crime doesn't pay
But I don't know any other way

She orders the pilot to land
She just wants to hold the man
Well I am her pilot today
Teaspoon

Washington's on the one
I'm in the middle of speaking
And you're under the gun
Seething, leave it to the lone nut
It's unappealing in someone so young
Plaintive, you're feeling so washed up
And you mean it when you say you're done
Five lanes of freeway
But it's all gone dark
You called to say you're gonna run
Well,Can you wait?
Can you stand it?
Are you brave or are you scared straight?
Speak right, be strong, act nice, take so long
Call time, seem tired, leave mad, get so wired
Maybe you belong to someone
Maybe you have finally met them
Maybe smoke belongs in the sky
Maybe I hate it when you cry
You were hurt so you got hard
You were cursed and scolded and scared
You were searched for, then ignored
You want to burn the liars?
You'll set us both on fire
You're faking, so I'm pretend sleeping
Waiting for this to be fun
It's true little miss mean mini-bar guard
We're gonna have to try something new
Let me breath fire down on you

I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you
I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you

In old Transylvania when I was a lad
Our castle was poor but we never were sad
We learned to be happy
We'd dance round the hall
And learning to count was the key to it all
By counting each count I knew just where to start
And one special step has stayed close to my heart

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

So now in my own castle I can enjoy
This wonderful dance that I learned as a boy
I see just how wise was my whole family
They taught me to count and so now look at me
I'm counting and dancing and I swear that it's true
If you do the same you will be happy too

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

One bat hanging in the steeple
One bat flies in through the door
That makes two bats in my belfry
WONDERFUL!
(spoken) But wait, there's more ...

Once up on a time a man was attacked by a vampire bird
He was sucked to death
The vampire bird killed him at last

Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat

The lake of fire tore his ass up
He was burning to the crisp
He was cast into the lake of burning flame

Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat

After the vampire bird sucked blood out of me, he started stabbing me in my ass
Then three more vampire birds stabbed me in my ass too
They sucked the blood out of me, killing me

Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat

Folgers, it's good to the last drop

I'm not afraid to show you who I am
And I am not ashamed of my life
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road
I've always felt you deep in my bones

With every step I rise and fall
With everything to gain I end up losing it all
When the darkness gets in
I scream out and your light sets me free

I'm not afraid of the past no more
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good
I used to dance to the devil's beat
If I could bust into hell I would

I'm not afraid to shed all my skin
I'm not afraid of the faults you see
I'm tearing down these walls right now
They're comin' down 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

I'm not afraid when they kick me down
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed
I'm not afraid if I live or die
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

And I wish that I could give you something in return
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned

And in the end you'll finally see
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need

I'm not afraid of the the truth no more
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did

I'm not afraid of the things you know
I'm just a book for the world to read
My final words on the final page
Will be amends 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black
The way me forgive me and just take me back
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black

Saw your nightmare bat go by my window
Saw them two lingering
Couldn't be a rabbit
Flying like usual
Couldn't be the habit
You saw them, too
Oh, every evening

So oh, goes
Oh, into the nightmare
Sun rising black instead of gold
Now or never
Saw your nightmare bat go by my window

Here I lie
In a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time
In a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home
I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you
You're goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you
You're goin' nowhere

Night and day
There's a burning down inside of me
Burning love
With a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go
And I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear

Simpletons cross my path, I don't know this anymore
Looking after me, I don't hear them anymore
The writer send the words, I don't read them anymore
I will wait for you, until the day
Yes I will wait for you, if I may
The day's a longer time for you
And it will all be fine for you

Giants and dragons fight, I don't feel them anymore
Apples and oranges, I can't taste them like before
The simple things again, I don't feel them anymore
I will wait for you, until the day
Yes I will wait for you, if I may
The day's a longer time for you
And it will all be fine for you

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

I will call upon Your name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine

If there is a love song left to sing
Then what I have is what I'll bring
Nothing more is more than I can give

If there is a light left in my eyes
It must be your reflection from the sky
'Cause all I know is this
You are the wonder of my world

You are an ocean that I can get lost in
The first wind on my shore
You are the sunrise to open my eyes
And the dark night is no more
You are an ocean, You are an ocean

And every time I turn around
There's so much more left to be found
And every glimpse steals my breath away

So open up these eyes to see
More of you and less of me
And all my fear is turning into faith
You are the wonder of my world

You are an ocean that I can get lost in
The first wind on my shore
You are the sunrise to open my eyes
And the dark night is no more
You are an ocean, You are an ocean

I'm drowning in your love
I'm drowning in your love
Not coming up
I'm not coming up
'Cause you're all I'll ever want

You are an ocean, You are an ocean

You are an ocean that I can get lost in
The first wind on my shore
You are the sunrise to open my eyes
And the dark night is no more
You are an ocean, You are an ocean
You are an ocean, You are an ocean

You are an ocean

So you think you're in the middle of the ocean
Stranded on an island of your own
Or stuck in the top of a mountain
Either way you're gonna say you're all alone
And I hesitate to say that you're a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I'm leaving you to you or someone else
'Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I'd meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me go
It used to be I'd tell you all my secrets
Giving you the credit you deserve
I guess you didn't care to lose or keep it
And we never quite connected from the first
And I wish I had a way to make it better
To rearrange the world and make you smile
But it's dumb to even think I had that power
And we haven't been that close in a while
And I don't even want to try to name it
Explain it for the one who couldn't care
'Cause all that matters is the way you choose to frame it
And I hesitate to say that you're a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I'm leaving you to you or someone else
'Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I'd meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me go

Here comes the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves where've they been ?

Don't swim tonight my love
The sea is mad my love
It's known to drive men crazy
Now come that murder seeks
The castle is dead and reeks
The madness can make you lazy

Here come the waves
down by the shore
Washing the rocks that have been here
centuries or more

Down by the sea

Here come the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves where've they been ?

Castles glowing at night
Towers above out fright
What did happen here
Now comes it in my head
I serve you bread on a pledge
Think of your mouth for dinner

But here come the waves
down by the sea
Washing the eyes of the men
who have died

Down by the sea

Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves





She scratches a letter
Into a wall made of stone
Maybe, someday another child
Won't feel as alone as she does

It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid fuck and Mommy agrees

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play, pretend
She could join the game, boy
She could be another clone

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

What you taught me, put me here
Don't come visit, Mother
Sing it

Oh, why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

What you taught me, put me here
Now don't visit Mother, Mother

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I see elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady
Docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road

Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch

Uh huh, uh huh

You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

When I went to your town on the wide open shore
Oh I must confess, I was drawn, I was drawn to the ocean
I thought it spoke to me, it said, "Look at us,
We're not churches, not schools, not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?"
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body
And that's when I came back to town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly, oh the ocean said
"What are you trying to find, I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors, I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean,"
But the ocean can't come to this town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

And the ones that can know you so well are the ones that can swallow you whole.
I have a good and I have an evil, I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I didn't go back today
I wanted to show you that I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them
You said, "Let me tell you the song of this town"
You said, "Everything closes at five. After that, well, you just got the bars
You don't know how precious you are, walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean.

It's where we came from, you know, and sometimes I just want to go back
After a day, we drink til we're drowning, walk to the ocean, wade in with our work boots
Wade in our work boots, try to finish the job.
You don't know how precious you are, I am the one who lives with the ocean
You don't know how I am the one. You don't know how I am the one."

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Ain't no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door
Got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball.
Got a hell hound on my t(r)ail'
'Cause it's hell I'm headed for'
(No one really knows which one it is)
Uh-huh! oh oh yeah!
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing 'bout good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, then the ocean lost it's way.
I've been there (I don't know?)
Oh oh yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Na na na..., la la la...
Sitting round singing songs til the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start.
Oh yeah!
It sure is fine!
Blow my mind!
(He's saying _something_ here)
Yeah yeah!
Do wop a diddly diddly...
Oh, so good!

When I went to your town
On the wide open shore
Oh, I must confess, I was drawn
I was drawn to the ocean

I thought it spoke to me, It said, "Look at us

Not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?"
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body

And that's when I came back to town
This town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are
You don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming, back from the ocean

I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers
I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly

Oh, the ocean said, "What are you trying to find
I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors
I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh, it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean"

But the ocean can't come to this town
This town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are
You don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean

And the ones that can know you so well
Are the ones, that can swallow you whole
I have a good and I have an evil
I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean

I didn't go back today, I wanted to show you
That I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers, I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them

You said, "Let me tell you the song of this town"
You said, "Everything closes at five
After that, well you just got the bars"

You don't know how precious you are
Walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean
It's where we came from, you know
And sometimes I just want to go back
After a day, we drink 'til we're drowning

Walk to the ocean, wade in with our workboots
Wade in our workboots, try to finish the job
You don't know how precious you are
I am the one who lives with the ocean
You don't know how, I am the one
You don't know how, I am the one

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

And from the tips of your fingers
Down to the soles of your feet
A glimmer in your skin
That I can't believe
And take a trip to the sea
Let your hair run, run free
You're a rebel in disguise
Is that the devil in your eyes

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

Wider smiles than I've ever seen
Your little arms hug your body
This is more than I can take
You're the fruit that I can taste
You only seek what you give away
You'll only speak what you wanna say
You ululate like a warrior
I'll make you shake like your bed girl

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

This is our garden girl
We live in a fractured world
Willing to be the same
Same as it always was
We're in a rapture girl
We live in a lonely world
Willing to be the same
Same as it always was

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

I'll have to think about it, it's what she said to me
I'll have to think about it, all the time in the world to be
When I sleep I dream about it
I chew it when I eat
After something I can't explain
The court's adjourned in the big debate
The way you are, that's the worst thing you could do
Don't you know that's the worst thing?
Fantasyland
Come dig my art, I'm just rehearsing
I'll have to think about it, it's what she said to me
When you leave behind all the guts it takes
Who will you be?
The way you are, that's the worst thing you could do
Don't you know that's the worst thing?






I have tasted poison, still I remain restored
By centuries of saving seas where living waters pour

I am the ocean
Purified by all the tears of time
I am bitter and sublime
I am the ocean

Disregard the wreckage under healing tide
All the shame in Jesus' name
Was covered when He died

We are the ocean
Glorious and sanctified by pain
We are blessed by the rain
We are the ocean

Acid clouds will threaten but you won't be defiled
Cleansing love from God above will shower you dear
Child

You are the ocean,
Beautiful and driven by the wind
You are wondrous deep within
You are the ocean
I am the ocean
Purified by all the tears of time
I am bitter and sublime
I am the ocean
We are the ocean
You are the ocean

Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

I've got to keep on keepin' on
I just want to be beside you
Gotta do the best I can
Even though you made it plain
You don't believe in love
I cant let you go

Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man
The rhythm of your heart is like a sonnet
Pure and sweet
How you haunt my memory

Believe me baby
In this brilliant world you're the best
You're like a porcelain charm
A perfumed smile
A teenage blush
You're like champagne roses

Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man

I've got to keep on keeping on
How can I live without you
I've got to make you understand
Each species has a mate
And fate says you'll be mine
I won't let you down

Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man
The rhythm of your heart is like a sonnet
Pure and sweet
How you haunt my memory

I believe in angels
You leave me no alternative
You're like a butterfly
A gospel choir
A sun kissed sky
You're like sensual velvet

Believe me baby
In this brilliant world you're the best
You're like a porcelain charm
A perfumed smile
A teenage blush
You're like sunshine roses
Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man

Don't want to be the one to walk away
But I can't bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost

Can't find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Oh, we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven, help me find a way to dream within this nightmare

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Could you ever look at me
The way you're looking at the ocean
All wounded in your smile, but holy and unriled
Could you ever look at me

Could you ever look at me
The way you're looking at the sunrise
How it settles on your face, whole and unafraid
Like the light of your world

And I don't know how
To chase away the fear I have inside me
And I don't know where it is you go
When you drift away, when you drift away

Could you ever look at me
The way you're looking at the ocean
Could you give to me that smile, if only for a while
Could you ever look at me

I don't know how
To find a way to keep you here beside me
And I don't know where it is you go
But it's beautiful to me, so beautiful to see

I hope you never look at me
The way you're looking at the ocean
'Cause in the sunrise I have seen I was never meant to be
The light of your world

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love

Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling down
Got an inch but took a mile, oh no

Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cutting deep oh no

Watch me fall now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I love you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much your're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love

Baby, I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain

Oh now you get the picture
Oh oh now you wanna fix her
Oh now your screaming let's go back
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me

Watch me fall now, I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I love you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much your're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain how come I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love

I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love
I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love
I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love

i turned the volume up this morning
till there was ringing in my ears
i haven't felt this good in years

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout

and as i'm searching for the story
subscription card falls on the floor
i'm losing interest more and more

to pick it up i'm bending over
out of the corner of my eye
i see a pair of blazing thighs

see how they twist and shout
see how they twist and shout

i straighten up to look her over
and up my back a shooting pain
it's bound to settle in my brain

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout
see how they twist and shout





All day
All night
I've been thinkin why feelin' wrong feels so right
And I know
Yeah I try
To turn myself around but I know what I like

I ain't nice
No I'm quite a dick
I'm the bad guy who's makin' you sick
It's easy for me
I've got no shame
I'm in it for the money and fame

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

There's days when I wanna give in
But it's hard to be a saint when you're full of sin
Why would I ever think of goin' back
When it feels so fuckin' good to be bad

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

I know that secretly
Everybody's rootin' for me

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Because the villain is here to stay

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

And I'm here to stay

I'm the villain

And the villain always wins when the hero's away

Never mind who set you up
Never mind who started it
Never mind what kept you going now

Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys

I been in this town so long that back in the city I been
Taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the
Spanish and Indian home of the Heroes and Villains.

Once at night, cotillion squared, the fight, and she was right
In the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what
A dude'll do in a town full of Heroes and Villains.

Heroes and Villains
Just see what you done-done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you done-done

Stand or fall, I know there shall be peace in the valley, and
It's all an affair of my life with the Heroes and Villains.

In the cantina, Margarita keeps the spirits high.
There I watched her, she spun around and wound in
The warmth, her body fanned the flame of the dance.

Dance Margarita! Don't you know I love you!

My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise.
They started slow long ago, head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise.

I been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff to ride in the rough, and Sonny,
Down snuff, I'm alright by the Heroes and Villains.

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually
Brought her down

I'm not gone be your villain anymore
Don't think I'll live a life of keeping score
I know there's something more to life
I'm sure, no, I won't be your villain anymore, anymore

I played my part, I tried to do your way
But now it's time for me to just do me
You see, I don't want to haunt you or be selfish
But I can't be your villain, baby

I'm am not your prisoner
No, you just have to let me go now
And let me be
Who I see in me, yeh

I'm so cold and far away from home
I'm so tired and so damn alone
It's darker and much harder to be me
So far away from my reality
I hate the way you look, I'm looking back
I hate the way I look, you're looking too
I think maybe I'm just falling

Cause you kiss me like you know inside of me
And you watch me fight my own insanity
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I'm stronger now than I've ever bean before

You think I never could have seen it all
It seems you want me just to watch me fall
Your fingers and your lips are beautiful
Your fingers and your lips are killing me
I hate the way you look, I'm looking back
I hate the way I look, you're looking too
I think maybe I'm just falling

Cause you kiss me like you know inside of me
And you watch me fight my own insanity
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I'm stronger now than I've ever was before

I'm stronger than I've ever been
I'm stronger than before
But you kiss me like you know it all, you know it all, you know it all

Cause you kiss me like you know inside of me
And you watch me fight my own insanity
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I'm stronger now than I've ever was before
And I'm stronger now than I've ever was before

I could be the villain in your
Little book of break-ups
So spinnerule but even now
I could be your page in your
Little book of break-ups

I'm never letting go.

I'd tear into myself again.
(Myself, myself)
My skin rips like paper.
I'll never touch myself again.
(Myself, myself)

Your heart breaks like glass.

I should have been the hero in your
Little book of make-ups
But that anyone should say to you
I should have been the figure in your
Little book of make-ups

Your heart breaks like glass
Still I find a way
To fight the brilliance of your inside in this lifetime
I won't regret
I won't regret it.

What can I say? It's my turn to play the villain now.
I bet you can relate, to what I've grown to hate.
You won't feel this. You won't feel a thing.

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.

It's not my turn to fall. It's your turn after all...
This revenge is catching up to you, better slow it down.
Refusing to sink in. Giving up was your way then (this battle has yet to begin).

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.
Rest assured now.

This is where decision meets consequence.
I'll find a comeback at the bottom of this glass again.
You won't feel a thing.

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.

Rest assured now

When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken,
Sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's
Vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth a
Valium and slept
Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his
Head on the floor
Think somebody now and how he never really
Wept he says

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our
Heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to
Slip, we'd say

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmen

When my love complained, every word
A breath on my last dandelion
And so lovers will leave and their tears
Souvenirs for the very first time
I searched the world reluctant
To find a lover enthusiastic
Speak to me barely if at all

When I was a boy, funny things
Water wings kept you confident
A belly of wine, similar
To keep yourself indifferent

And I scraped the bargain basement
Bought a lover less than fantastic
Spoke to me barely if at all

Taste perfume that burns my throat
And I am free of envelope
Squeeze an instant out of me

And she placed a hand between our lips
How could anything be so precious
She kissed me barley if at all

And she, with her hand between our lips
Gave me what we now have in common
She left me barely if at all

And if I ever drive you mild, and
Suffering this open kiss
And I'm barely juvenile

When everyone is outrageous,
And I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon

And if I ever drive your style, and
Suffering your day predicted
With no ability to rile

And every yawn is is contagious
And I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon

I should drive you wild,
Yes I should drive you wild

Ever drive you mild
Ever drive you mild
Ever drive you mild





We are for today
We are for the moment

We are a crusade
But we are invalid

1 A.M. rummaging
Stained my hands on her antique
2 A.M.

Reverend girl

And I am so indifferent
And I am whatever

3 A.M. cellophane
suffocates my favorite things
4 A.M.

The reverend girl
Seems that the more we're achieving
The less chance of leaving this world
With a reverend girl

Another lover wakes me
Head upon the window pane
Before the thunder shook us
She could always smell the rain

A year is dissipating
Another hail cannot disdain
Nevermind the thunder
Now my lover smells like
Now my lover smells like
Now my lover smells like rain

I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say "187", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stares, give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind, hah

Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes, fuck all you hoes
1 million, 2 million, 3, 4

Uh, breaking up the kush, sticky fingers-onics
I'm throwing up gang signs you can see I'm in my vomit
And I'm cool right na' but please dont change the climate
'Cause I'm sleeping with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me
Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry
You niggas old news prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finga, bad bitches for my home boys
The grass is greener on the other side, I'm focused on my own yard
Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann
Take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder

Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes, fuck all you hoes
1 million, 2 million, 3, 4

We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing
And my bitch got cotton mouth, you know them snakes cannot be trusted
And I bet y'all niggas don't say shit, because I'm feeling lucky
And I still pray everynight that Aliens abduct me, Tunechi
Whattup Khaled?

Wait
The fact you did it
But don't admit it
Won't make you innocent

Fate
Will find you wicked
And turns you victim
For everything you have done
So justify the reason to kill

Reason to kill
I bet you will
You're fooling no one but yourself
But yourself
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just get it
How you manage
To justify who dies
Like judge and jury
You're the very
One who crucifies
Don't get your hands dirty to kill
Dirty to kill
Use someone else
Know all your lies are measured in hell

Measured in hell
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

[Chorus]

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

[Liffy Stokes]
The stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul
I'm 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole
I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying
I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying

Not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball
While waiting for this pussy ass job to call
And it ain't hopping
Got me tipping to hear them things popping

Cash bags dropping
With plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking
Its what I'm on
I cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone

24 years and grown with a future unknown
My heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game
But I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane
So its back to pistols and cane

Plotting on licks hitting stains
The mob life runs through my veins
Its too late for me to change
These streets got me deranged

Strapped up and paranoid
Ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid
Plus big voices getting hot
They constantly sneaking on blocks

They trying to bring me in unconscious
But them pins got popped
Now they got me on the run
Cherishing every last breath

But I ain't going back
Its freedom or death
That be my motive for murder

[Chorus]
[Liffy Stokes]
Now I know you the judge of life and death
I ain't evil or nothing
But somebody done brought me pain and sorrow
So I'ma have to kill something
Let me count the ways that I can repent
Trying to stay holy and focused
But that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus
That be my motive for murder

[Twista]
I'm a survive these streets another day
I know the pain in my heart won't go away
These mother fuckers try to murder me
And won't nobdy hurt my family
That's what he gotta die

[Mays]
9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick
If it ain't coming up with the dopest shit
Then I'm trying to cop the thickest brick
'Cause life in the belly of the best

Is equal to povertys bottomless pit
Where bitch niggas trick
And thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get
But it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick

Before its too late to get straight
And the most I make is final pick
Anywhere they shit like riding slick
With a thick chick slobbing your dick

Even if it means fighting these niggas in cases
As long as neither ones thick
'Cause I swear when I get hit
I go in a crucial rage like a flick

Turn straight lunatic
Making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick
But that don't mean my minds sick
Just cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese

When trees by the p's
And fuckin' fine fee's and 3's with ease
For sure the skilled poets
Within in the mask up kill for it

I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill
I'll bet his dumb ass will still blow it
Bullshit ain't nothing
I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank

And drive a bullet-proof hummer tank
So the next haters who try to air me out come up blank
And I'm a have to sacrifice your life
With a wrath that's stronger than christ

And forces of life that's know to do damage to human eyesight
I guess its true
Moneys the route of all evil
'Cause crooked or legal

It's all manipulated by the eagle
And be my motive for murder

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start
How I'm a hide love from this mark
This nigga made my homie die in my arms
Had to put a slug in his heart

Mother fuck that stuff
It was just a grudge on his part
My boy was young and ambitious
Took his dreams and wishes

Try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches
Drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack
And a quarter ounce of dro want a rap
I'm bout to snap

Here come the big pay back
Looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap
I'm crying and shit
I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him

Even if a slug hit him
I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him
Can't control them pains
Now its time to throw them things

Visions of the stud don't stay
Empty the clip of am out right
Ambulance come around
By the time the hypes

Taking of his nikes
I know it sound cold
But this bullet put a hole in my soul
Never shorties years stole

He was only 17 years old
And at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll
And I know he used to wild sometimes
Carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine

No more reminiscing on the fun times
Balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines
But this nigga ain't going to want mine
For the pain I'm a handle this funk and dismantle this junk

Fuck all that
In all black and then pumped
To run up on this nigga
Tip up on him then jump

Mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
Eyes gleam with the fury
Never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers
In front of a prosecuting team and a jury

How did one murder turn into 2
Revenge had me shooting through hate
I couldn't stop
In the mist of the action

Is when that little ? got shot
All because of my motive for murder

[Chorus]

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who, yeah

Well we just met but girl there's something that I like
I'll get right to the point, I will not waste your time, I said,
I'd like to get to know you inside out and backwards, then I'll know

I like your smile but I love the way you laugh
I keep on thinking that I know you from my past, I said,
I'm giving what you need
Well I should gain control but I can't stop thinking

Girl I wanna drink from your cup
You got me goin' girl, I can't get enough
Wanna taste you on my lips, girl I'm in lust
You got me goin', you got me goin'

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who, yeah

I like the way you talk, I love the words you choose
You keep surprising me with all your thoughts and views, I think,
Is she too good to be true?
Cause I don't think I ever met a girl like you

And I won't wait or waste your time
And I'll tell you what's on my mind
I need you and you need me
Well I am here to fulfill all your needs

Girl I wanna drink from your cup
You got me goin' girl, I can't get enough
Wanna taste you on my lips, girl I'm in lust
You got me goin', you got me goin'

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who

Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big moneyin' to most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothin' is figurative
I can wish it into existence, god want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, "Nas did this"
Pointin' to they scars like, "right here, baby, really Nas did this"
Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap jack dempsey, matte black bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, passin' 'round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensary
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

Yo, what we talkin' 'bout niggas?
What we talkin' 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, nasty, what, recollect, fucker

At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'
Integrity intact, reppin' hard
They askin' how he disappear and reappear back on top
Sayin', "Nas must have naked pictures of god or somethin'"
To keep winnin' is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathin', I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like trump bein' up down up, play with cash

My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to bushwick
Harlem, bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?

At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felissimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot
Staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reachin', soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin'
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beastin'
Lookin' for the juks young, but now we older chiefin'
In my truck, play the greatest adventures of slick rick
Buggin' on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol agin' my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I? must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

This for my trapped in the 90's niggas
For my trapped in the 90's niggas
Ha, for y'all niggas

42nd street terminal

Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big money and the most
Uninhibited freak to sleep with

I was too proud to call you that night
I couldn't run, I know running gets old in a way
You sure know how to make or break a day
Well, you just fled the scene, so out of reach

You think a lot about yourself so much
For someone who relies on someone else's trust
I cower to your touch, you think I'd be the one to let go
So carry on

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah

This jealousy can't hold me over
I can't get mad, you know that anger gets all in your way
My jealous mind, it hates it but takes it
Those haunting memories are laced with secrets

Although I'm hard pressed and back from a fight
You think that this would end soon but it's taking its time
Confusion it is such an all time bad written melody
Of course you'd sing, please carry on

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah

Ask about her ways and her secret life
She'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask her if she thinks she can sleep at night
She'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask about her ways and her secret life
Ask her if she thinks she can sleep at night

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah

She's in love, she's in love
(She's in love, she's in love)
She's in love, she's in love
(She's in love, she's in love)
She's in love, she don't love you no more
She's in love with her motive, yeah

We've got unfinished business you and I
Yeah, something is stalking your head
Find, tear it down, inhale it's prophecy
Release the steel that lies behind the seal

You need this, c'mon and stand on your own two feet
You've dreamt it, make it real
You're the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
You're the love, true love at the midnight hour

Steady as a rock, smiling with blood on my hands
It feels so good watching the wasteland grow
Yeah, it pounds my head real hard, you're right my love
This sweet pain makes me do it no other way

You need this, c'mon and stand on your own two feet
You've dreamt it, make it real
You're the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
You're the love, true love at the midnight hour

The midnight hour
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight, the midnight hour

Yeah, with no apparent motive I snatch the lives of you
Good deed immunity, a madman living his dream

With only death in mind I make you disappear
And as I ride the universe no one conquers my fall

I need this, c'mon see me stand on my own two feet
I've dreamt it, now it's real
I'm the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
I'm the love, true love at the midnight hour

The midnight hour

Love and hate 'til death do us part

From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

I've seen places, faces
And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say "No"

To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I'd fly to you
From Russia with love

When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

Big black train coming round the bend
Go on kin folk tell your mom and them

Chugg a lugga, chugg a lugga, chugg a lugga
Who? The big black neck commin' through to you boy you done fell and bumped you head, uh huh
That's what they said
People say it's impossible, not probable, too radical
But I already been on the CMA's
Hell Tim McGraw said he liked the change
That he likes the way my hick-hop sounds and the way the crowd screams when I stomp the ground
Now, big and black, clickty-clack and I make the train jump the track like that

I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Yeah

From my deep decent deep into your ear
My voice is your choice that you wanted to hear
Southern boy makin' noise where the buffalo roam
Less denim an' bone that you might have known
See me ridin' into town like a desperado
With a big belt buckle
The cowboy bravado
All over the World Wide Web you'll see download CBT on that MP3
Speak clearly what I'm sayin' so you comprehend in the name of hick-hop radio tune in
Rollin' like thunder on to the scene
It's kinda hard to describe if you know what I mean
I never claimed to be the hardest of the brother's hard rock
But I'm booming out the box
Skills got you jumping out your socks
From Texas here I come movin' your body with the bass kick drum

I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Yeah

I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Yeah

Huh, yea, one time
Get you some of that

Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!

Well we enter the facility, the place is jumpin'
Everything is crowded, the music is bumpin'
We make a lap with drink in hand
Try to walk around but we're in demand
About then sweety went to the ladies room
And that's when the DJ played the boom
Boom, boom, bang-biggity-bang
I looked over my shoulder and I was like "Dang!"
A chick was dancin' on the bar so I double checked
Sweety came back, something wrong with your head?
I said,


Like the fellas on the beach in the summertime
Checkin' out the girls walkin' up and down the coastline
Splashin' in the surf in their bikinis
Others tan on a blanket while they sip martinis
All winter long fellas did those crunches
'Cause girls are like bananas, man, they roll in bunches
Lookin' for fun but didn't keep it in check
What happened to you boy? I got a crick in my neck!


Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
You're hanging on my words like a life preserver
My rhyme is your table and I'll be your server
Paid attention to the song like a record exec
Bobbed your head up and down and got a crick in your neck!





Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

Well, I'm three weeks late on my credit card payment
The lady on the phone said she wants to make arrangements
"Put a little down, Can you pay a little on it?"
My wallet's too flat, couldn't pay if I wanted
They're callin' on my job, I'm gettin' letters in the mail
The haters in the hood all hopin' that I fail
My pocket's on Slimfast, tank on empty
Used to have friends said they wanna stick with me
Dogs in my stomach, 'cause now I'm getting hungry
Really under pressure wanna talk to my mommy
People on the corner askin' me for change?!
Gotta find me a job with a higher pay range
I've gotta tough time trying to pay my bills
If I hit the jackpot, that'll cure my ills
My credit is a joke and the banks ain't lendin'
Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin' (What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
The dang landlord's knockin' on my front door
Said he wants the rent from two weeks before
I want to make a call, huh I can't use the phone
That was late too, couldn't get a dial tone
Got snow on my TV, no mo' cable
Gotta use my strats, keepin' food on my table
My car note overdue, the bank's talkin' repo
Gotta take my girl to the matinee show
I'm makin' sure she takes a purse big as a tent
Sneakin' in candy bars for 89 cents
I take her to the buffet later in the evenin'
All you can eat, gotta maximize your feedin'
Gotta tough time trying to pay my bills
If I hit the jackpot that'll cure my ills
My credit is a joke and the banks ain't lendin'
Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Sho' nuff!)

See we live in a world of false pretense
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
My credit is a joke, the banks ain't lendin'
I ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'
Livin' in a world of false pretense
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
My credit is a joke, the banks ain't lendin'
I ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')

Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

[Verse 1]
Escuchen a la musica, the beat is groovin' ya
Groovin' with the record in secreto why la publica
It's the Cowboy with the fresh genre
The groove kinda smooth, make it wanna stick on ya
Comin' outta Dallas, puro eastside
Listen to this song as you're rollin' in your ride
Bumpin' up the street in your clean Impala
Suckers get mad, make 'em wanna holla
I'm the one who's preferred when you're makin' your selection
The verbal disinfectant just to guard against infection
I'm servin' everybody with a lyrical feast
I'm not John Travolta but I'm slicker than grease
On the floor that the janitor just quit moppin'
Maintain focus so there ain't no stoppin'
Stay unified everybody hick-hoppin'
And like whipped cream I'm gonna be chart toppin'

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, aw yeah, hit you with the beat that'll straighten your hair
Orale a mis carnales, puro tejano cowboy from Dallas
Uh-huh, aw yeah, hit you with the beat that'll straighten your hair
Orale a mis carnales, puro tejano cowboy from Dallas

[Verse 2]
Aw yeah, El Tejano no chavala
Esta cancion esta garantizada
The Texican is gonna flex again
Gonna put that rhyme in your chest again
Am I representin' (True that!!)
(Come on Troy, do that!!)
All up in your area, people sayin' (who dat?!)
Pongan atencion por este tipo de cancion
Why todas los ratones no tienen corazon
You try to say es imposible
Believe me for sheezy es incredible
No comprendes tu no entiendes
You try to understand it but you cannot defend this!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Latin Interlude]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Cowboy Troy]
Uh-huh, aw yeah!
Uh-huh, aw yeah!
Uh-huh, aw yeah!
Uh-huh, aw yeah!

Like dust in the wind sand slips through your fingers
Similar to shattered dreams that still linger
Trying to succeed in whatever you do
But the failures of the past seem to laugh and mock you

I'm worse than a has been 'cause you say I never will be
I'm just tryin' to excel so you feel me
'Cause boundaries are made to be broken
And I'm leavin' all the name sayers chokin'

On the dust that I'm kickin' up behind me
It's difficult findin' words to define me
The hick hop cowboy from the D A double L A S
So fresh in the contest

Rockin' stages like Guns N' Roses
I been flowin' since Madonna was strikin' poses
I can't quit now 'cause there's too much buzz
And I'm gettin' my chance because

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you and smilin' on me

I remember the days sittin' in the pews
When I heard the preacher sayin', "Spread the news"
I was feelin' the blues 'til I had a chance to choose
Now I feel the love to the soles of my shoes

Try to walk in a path of the guiding light
I thank the Lord for everything when I pray at night
'Cause I can feel His strength, I can feel His power
He's the one I turn to in my darkest hour

Try to be a good man, never called a saint
Never walked on water so I know I ain't
I might swim in the whiskey
But I'm bathed in the blood of the lamb

If you want peace raise your hand
And when Heaven comes, it won't be no drama
And if you see her first say, "Hi" to my Mama

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you, He's smilin' on me

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you, He's smilin' on me

In a smoky room, I see you
And you're dancin' to a groovin' tune
Just mellow out, shake your, mmm
And do your thang, baby do your thang

You gotta blonde, a redhead, a brunette
In the gym working up a sweat
One on the treadmill, one on the bike
One in kickboxing class all night
Doing their best to work it out
Tryin' to get a nice body and a nice "Badow"
You love to hear words comin' out of their mouths
These girls are G.R.I.T.S., 'Girls Raised In The South'

Gonna get cleaned up, meet at the spot
Each one is confident she's pretty hot
Hate to see them go but you love to watch them leave
Go on ladies just do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

The witching hour and the club is packed
And we're doing it and we're doing it fast
The lights are bright, cocktails strong
Just do your thang, baby do your thang

Man look at that face, silhouette body
Kickin' so hard you thought she knew karate
Send a 'Thank you' to her dad and mom
'Cause once she smiles boy you know what's on
You know she has nice etiquette
But she'll laugh even though she doesn't get it yet
You want to hear her say no one can do it better
Next she's callin' out the 15th letter

Better recognize, get woke to some act rights
She'll get to the point like stalagmites
Bouncin' in the club in the black light
Girl so fine bow down like a jack-knife
She ain't frontin', she ain't stuntin'
Swingin' for the fence boy, she ain't buntin'
She's educated but she's fluent in street slang
Go on girl, just do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Early in the mornin', I'm up and I'm out
Hopin' one day my album goes platinum
Rockin' that mic so viciously
Deliciously, not maliciously

When atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure converge
There's a party surge, so I must emerge
Get the people hyped and keep going nonstop
Knock the party off the meter when the bass line drops

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Ichi-nichi-ju, Ichi-nichi-ju
Kuroi Amerikajin yoru

The last of the Brohicans is speakin'
The one that you turn to each and every weekend
Risin', peakin' while the bump is beatin'
Don't turn back, no retreatin'

You can see my vision, you can feel my force
Time to hit the trail, boy, the mic is my horse
I tantalize and tickle your tympanic with my English
Smile as you listen to the ruckus

As I bring this mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Ichi-nichi-ju, Ichi-nichi-ju
Kuroi Amerikajin yoru
All day long, all day long
Cowboy Troy bringin' you this song
All day long, all day long
Cowboy Troy bringin' you this song

I'm comin' with the best and fresh from out west
Bus driver takin' you to school to pass the test
See, I'm lyrically hypnotic, at times even psychotic
Neurotic, bionic and it may leave you catatonic

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

The street is cold, the dawn is grey
My heart says no but my head says stay
My work is finished, or so I've been told
Can't part the three of us, once we got a hold

I forgot the name
I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
Tell by the shape I'm in

In line of fire, you know what to say
They gave us no choices, just one shade of grey
My legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray
But I know each step we take, they're one step away

I found the secret, the key to the vault
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all

I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said

I find my own fun,
Sometimes for free I got to pay it to come lookin' for me
Walkin' on Gucci,
Wearin' Yves St. Laurent barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt

I, I saw you there, wanted you there
I, I knew that it was best for me
You brought me back to that place in my heart
I thought was gone, oh so long
I was unhappy now it's gone
And I'm moving on, moving on
I'm moving on

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

Pass the evening, bring tomorrow
How could we know that night would bring us into daylight
Combination all around us
Fill our heads with the love we've been feeling
For time long past

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

All the time, darling now, oh
All the time, now we'll have to make it up
We'll make it up, oh
All the days, darling now, oh
All the days, now we'll have to make them up
We'll make them up somehow
We'll make them up

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

I've got a secret combination
I'm gonna use it to lock away your love
I've got a standing obligation
Never to change it 'cause then I?d lose your love

All the girls in town are trying
To get on your good side
They don't know that you ain't buying
Now matter how they try, I know they'll never find out

My secret combination
(Secret combination)
I'm gonna use it to lock away your love
I've got a standing obligation
Never to change it 'cause then I?d lose your love

I've got a secret, yeah, yeah
Ain't gonna let it out, no, no
I've got a secret

Two people together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you

Tomorrow forever
We both had these promises for far too long
But now you make the words come true

So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can make me feel this way

[Chorus]
You and me
We are the right combination
For love (for love), we're all we need (oh)
It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key

Can't keep it a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you

You hold me, it's magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do

Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there

[Chorus]

And whenever you call I'm there
Every stairwell to fall I share
I'll be yours till we love I care about you, baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me belong
I'll be by your side forever

[Chorus]

I've been thinkin' too much, I've been drinkin' too much
And thinkin' and drinkin' for me is a dangerous combination
And I'm lonely as hell, with a story to tell
I'm talkin' to myself and that's a dangerous conversation

Baby, you could save me tonight
You could make everything alright
You're lookin' better by the minute
I'm tryin' to keep from falling in it

But you may be just a little too much temptation
If we're gonna turn back, better turn back now
I'd say no, but I don't know how
Girl, I really should be leaving
But that's another conversation
Baby, you and me tonight is a dangerous combination

I've been trying so hard, feel like crying so hard
Baby, I may die trying to find a taste of sweet salvation
But it all looks so clear through these glasses of beer
And in your eyes, I've stumbled upon a double shot of inspiration
A rock and a hard place, I'm in between
Come on, baby, and set me free

But you may be just a little too much temptation
If we're gonna turn back, better turn back now
I'd say no, but I don't know how
Girl, I really should be leaving
But that's another conversation
Baby, you and me tonight is a dangerous combination

Tell me does he ever stroke your body gently
Does he talk to you the way that I do
Does he look into your eyes and see his future
I know that I do when I'm loving you

He's been treating you like love is out of season
Girl there ain't no reason
You can have it all
What a woman needs

[Chorus]
This is how my heart beats
When I am making love to you
Listen to the sounds of how much I want you
Let your body feel my groove
I wanna get deep in you
This is what a woman needs day and night
What a woman needs

You need understanding love and devotion
So let me put it into motion
This is what I'll do for you

I'll break you off the way that you like
I'll be the priest you call in the night
I'll keep it real
So baby what's the deal

He's been treating you like love is out of season
Girl there ain't no reason
You can have it all
What a woman needs

[Chorus]

Everyday will be sunshine
'Cause what a woman needs
I'll give to you
Making love in the moonlight
I promise I will cherish you forever

[Chorus]

It seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I've missed you (miss you too)

[Chorus]
'Cause you you and I back together again
We got the world in a spin
'Cause you you and I back together again,
We got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
I'm here heart in hand
You take all that I got if you need it baby

[Chorus]

Love will last forever (that's true)
We can make it real (got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never
We can truly feel (watcha feel) (I feel like getting)

Back together
(Baby keep it real and I will be there till the end)

Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle here to stay (here to stay)
(We got the world)

[Chorus]

You know the deal
My life story from broke
We always talked about the bad times that turned into jokes
We spoke about you leaving the town, yo I was down
But now you're back in my life
I'm happy to have you around (I hold you down)
Remember the fun we have when we're young
You thought it was done, never none
We haven't begun
Together we come the land of living
I'm giving my heart to you every part
You the one I'm feeling

Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
It's so easy to do when you care

[Chorus]

Eh Maxi Priest a wha she a do
Seems she want to dance with the crew
She wants to dance all night
A what she a try
Look like she wants to mad the I

Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance do you wanna
Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance

Moving in cheek to cheek
Still in silence we don't speak
So intense in the groove
All she wants is to get rude
Rising up to the heat
I get chills down to my feet
When I'm begging her to stay
She just turns and says no way

[Chorus]
She likes to dance
She just a mad the up the crew
She doesn't want a romance
So tell me what to a do
She wants to tease
Eh eh Baby Boo
She's got a passion to please you
Weh you a do Poochie Lou
She wants to dance
She just a mad the up the crew
Just to give you the fever
So tell me what to a do
Just like an addiction
You just want it more and more

Sexy dress makes you dess
Leaves you yearning to caress
While she's burning like a fire
You're just melting with desire
You can look but you can't touch
And you just won't get too much
She's not into conversation
You won't get no explanation

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance do you wanna
Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance

Yow she leave we body a heat up
And we heart it a beat up
Degree knees weak up
Maxi Priest catch hiccup
What is on my mind
A me and her have to meet up
On her case an we naah give it up
Caah this here woman not easy
A wine how she a gwaan me just can't believe it
Excitement create wid every look she please we
Naah stop tease we

Like a fruit to tempt your taste
Pure excitement to her waist
Now you're fixed in a spell
Good or evil you can't tell

[Chorus x2]

Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise

To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
And I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it

[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance ooh
Oh just to hold your hand

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flowers grow
Oh into a lovely smile that's bloomin'
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true
And there's no way that I'll be losing you oh

[Chorus]

Oh baby baby baby

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flowers grow
Oh into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing you oh

[Chorus]

Oh take me right away
Take me right away
Just take me right away
Oh I wanna go there
I wanna go there

Walk away, just walk away

Eight o'clock, the purple clouds
I look outside my heart is heavy with regret
I never thought I could be standing so empty
And now your face I know I never will forget

They say this is love
And you go through things like this sometimes
Try and not to show, oh no
You know I know that it's over but I just can't let it go
And now that I know

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

Twilight, sun going down
The atmosphere is of romance is in the air
Reaching out for a piece of a memory
Final moments of our love we could share

But too many things undecided in between us
A life time and a day, oh yeah
Ooh, don't break the silence that surrounds us
'Cause there's nothing more to say and we'll have to pay

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

They say this is love
And you go through things like this sometimes
That's the way it goes oh no
I got so much emotion but I just can't let it go
No, no, no

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

Don't rush the move you gotta make
Don't give it all before you take
Just step aside and watch a while
Be prepared to walk an extra mile
Flip the switch and check the groove
And now's the time to stop talk and move
Education is the only way
To learn to live to fight another day

[Chorus]
We can make it if we try try try
Who's the mathematician Jah Jah on a mission try try try

Don't get caught in no desperation
Use your skill from your ghetto irration
Feel the vibration
Some people see it astrologically
But I didn't get that from my triga knowledgy

What a friend who would deceive
Use your faith when you believe
Thought he was a friend
The human love we thought was real
So off and on so what's the deal
Thought he was a friend yeah

[Chorus]

Now tell me
Who's the mathematician
Jah Jah on a mission
Trying to find a way in this world of attrition
Jah Jah on a mission
Work it out,work it out

Keep it real

We gotta find a sanctuary
Flip into the 21st century
Keep it real and lose the fakes
Learn all your lessons from your own mistakes
Children now will come of age
Let's keep the love as we set the stage
Justice for all we can stand tall
No more comin' from back against the wall hey

We can make it if we try try try
Who's the mathematician
Jah Jah on a mission

If love was a thing that money could buy
The rich would live and the poor would die yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I only have one heart
Don't tear it all apart
I don't know where to start
Cause I can't wait forever for you

The way you treat me baby
I just don't understand
The way you hold my hand
I thought I was your man
And all the things I wanted
And all that we've been through
I've never loved no one the way that I loved you

So why you treat me so bad
I almost go mad
I wouldn't do the things that you do
Now I'm sad
I thought I had you
Now it's an impossible dream that will never come true yeah

[Chorus]

Some things I hear you say
It just don't go that way
The things I see you do
Ooh what happen to you
So tell me what went wrong

I guess I had it wrong
Tell me what's going on

'Cause now I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
Girl if you don't want me
Set me free for a love
That's waiting for me
There's got to be a better way
And someone who really loves me

[Chorus]

Nanananana, nanananana I can't wait for you no way no way
Nanananana, nanananana I can't wait for you no way

I only have, have one heart
I only got one heart
I only have, have one heart
I don't know where to start
'Cause I can't wait forever for you

If love was a thing that money could buy
The rich would live and the poor would die

The minute I saw you
I wanted to hold you
But I kept it inside and my foolish pride
I wish that I'd told you

Why can't you be mine
And spend all of my time
I've so much to give and one life to live
I can't be without you

[Chorus]
If only I could be the one
To love you forever
If only I could be the one
To cherish forever

Don't know if we're coming or going
I just don't know what to do
And so scared to walk away without knowing ooh

What can I tell you
I just can't ignore you
Could I be the one, just let me be the one
Someone you can run to

[Chorus]

Too many words left unspoken, spoken
Girl I promise you your heart won't be broken no no
If you're looking for some love and affection
Then you're looking in the right direction

I wanna cherish you cherish you baby
Anyway you want me to
Cherish you, cherish you darling
For the rest of my life
Cherish you baby ooh yes I will

[Chorus x3]

When did you realize that addiction was your life?
The first time I pushed it through my veins.
The hug it gave me, I never experienced in my life. It wouldn't let me go

Writings on the wall but I can't see the words
It's, right in front of me but my vision is blurred
And, Is this love that makes the clear eye blurred?
Is this love that has me losing my mind

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'm a call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
'Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins

Now I can't live without him cause he's all that I breathe
I don't hang out much cause he's all that I need
This crazy intoxicating kind of feel
One day might be the death of me, oh

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'm a call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
'Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins

Hit it once, feels so good, hurt so bad, had enough
Pull me back, tear me out, fuck me up
I never know, at least we go together babe
(Just stay with me and It'll only love [?])
Forget about your worries, live it out like we're young
'Cause life's too short not to have fun
You be holding it down
Knock a couple more rounds
That feel good pain while you're running through my, my

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'm a call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
'Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins

It's easy to be persuaded
It's easy because I'm weak
If it were me I wouldn't make it
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Frequently sedated
Beast in my veins
If it's free I'm gonna take it
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Now I've got you

Goodbye my sad and lonely
Goodbye that love it's sick for me

Marked as a "new human breed", with the face ripped from the amorphic body,
Half breathing to not disturb this order.
Wired to a demo-god, upgrading the faith, downloading the holy soul-ware.
Saved or just safe?
Data flooding a weak brain, confused mind under mass media control,
Submissively taking the nourishment until it pukes with cybernetic dope.

New age has come, shiny screens display the true world.
How many bytes are You worth?
You get a "sweet" and it does the trick.
Be a clown or get the throne through knowing "more"?

Mental extermination machines, pumping shit into the brains.
Global factories mass-producing the new kind of man.
The numbered model scalped of identity, steered and deafened.
I cut the wires, I wrestle with the veins.
Must disconnect!

Millions of clones, humanoidal folk, being bred and dying,
Suffering the same kind of dole.
Touching the throne, the invisible throne, are the kings of lethargy
Chained to the fake crown.
Serving the gods, the digital gods, on the altar of stripped privacy.
Fucking system's sluts!

Vain, let's go
Let's welcome everybody to planet pit
And show 'em what worldwide music is

They call me Mr. Worldwide
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me, Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up 'cause,  now worldwide

When you become involved in the music business
But the funny thing is that half these fools don't know music
Don't know business, have no business in music, what is this?

I learned from the best, stayed away from the worst
Now I send off every verse in a hearse
Now every day is fifteenth and the first
No more food stamps, church

You boys can't get passed third base
Mad about your MC searchin'
I couldn't care less and couldn't give a fat baby's ass
If the car's got curtains

So they reap for the block
I speak to the globe, I got the model ?
Better do your homework papito
I took the 305 worldwide

Well I took the 305 worldwide

Why you think they call me, Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me, Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up 'cause I am worldwide

So far from you; other side of the wall
There's a bottomless cry that is spinning
Interdimensional, hidden inside
Of these lights which I seem to be missing

Marching ahead to silent beats
Bumping into these dead machines
You can hear everything with me
You can win everyone but me

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
I don't

Don't think I'll talk
Yeah I don't think I'll breathe
And I don't think I'll think
What you're thinking

All that I know of us is what was there
In the longest of stares we were sinking
Ashes to beauty; rust in lust
Passion attempts; misguided trust
Smoking your bag of trickery
Getting to love the little beast

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
I don't

In this wading pool
In this waiting room
I elevate us down

In a neglected olive tree
Here is the part you reach for me
Say that you have no need of this
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Again again again

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Who knows?
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
No Glow from above our heads
Nothing there to see you down on your knees
Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven
(Twenty years in the future)
Off in the future maybe there ain't no heaven
It's just you and me and maybe it's just as well
'Cause if there ain't no heaven maybe there ain't no hell?
Who knows?
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
Who knows?

Oh the veins of her Majesty the Queen
They're so regal and serene
How I'd love to say I'd been
Down the veins of her Majesty the Queen
Tunnel down their beauteous sheen
And tell everything I'd seen
Oh the Queen (Oh yes the Queen)
And her cellar full of dogs
(And all her dogs)
Wonder has she any frogs?
(Oh, has she frogs?)
Does she ever chop up logs?
(Or chop up logs?)
Whoa oh no (Oh, no Oh, no)
No, I don't suppose she does
(I don't suppose she does)
It would all be too much fuss
Anyway, she'd have a

Private detective with her
Private detective with her

Just making sure no one ever had a go
At her Majesty the Queen
Someone no one really knows
You might think you know your friends
(Oh, you might think you know your friends)
Even when they're on a screen
Yeah, but nobody pretends
(But nobody pretends)
That they really know the Queen
(They really know the Queen)
So I'd love to say I'd been
Somewhere deep inside
The veins of her Majesty the Queen

I see him standing silhouetted in the lamp-light
I cross the street and I quicken my pace
He cups his hands and he lights a cigarette
I find myself in the bones of his face

It's just the night in my veins, oh!
Making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night
Under my skin, slipping it in

He's got his hands in my hair and his lips everywhere
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

He's got me up against the back of a pick-up truck
Out of sight of the neon and glare
We might as well be on a beach under the moonlight
Love's language reads the same anywhere, yeah

It's just the night in my veins, oh!
Making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night
Under my skin, slipping it in

He's got his chest on my back across a new Cadillac
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

I've got my head on the curb and I can't produce a word
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

Take off my nothing inside
Take off my nothing inside
Green green green green
Temple, green, your simple guide
Bubble back in young beat
Glad, their rights
And this the far and
The quite time
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it

Fake it, green, take it, green,
Leave it, green, feel it,

Green, green, it's green they say
On the far side of the hill
Green, green, I'm going away
To where the grass is greener still

Ah well I told my mama on the day I was born
Don't you cry when you see I'm gone
Ya know there ain't no woman gonna settle me down
I just gotta be traveling on
Singing

[CHORUS]

Nah, there ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Gonna tell me to spend my time
I'm just a good-loving rambling man
Say, buddy, can ya spare me a dime?
Hear me crying, it's a

[CHORUS]

Yeah, I don't care when the sun goes down
Where I lay my weary head
Green, green valley or rocky road
It's there I'm gonna make my bed
Easy, now

[CHORUS]

Everybody, I want to hear it now

To where the grass is greener still
To where the grass is greener still

To where the grass is greener still

Look Out !

People used to call me backwards,
Living out here with the tractors,
Letting this world leave me behind.
Now-a-days I'm an innovator
I'm a country boy prognosticator
I'm a man ahead of my times

I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love,
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing

Sheets on the clothes line drying
Red Tail hawks a flying
A couple of deer on the timber line
And I know a lot more about cane pole fishing
then I ever will know about carbon emission
And my little corner of the world is doing just fine

I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans
I've got a guitar I play unplugged

And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing

Yeah, I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of root baked potatos and greens
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love,
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing
I was green before green was a thing

Oh yeah.

Amy
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely even know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
For a bunch of fools drown in shame
Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs
But it never really kept you safe
You're too young for the golden age
Cause the record bin's been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are you eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep

the Green Hornet!

You opened the door,
I let myself in.
Between you and me,
I only believe
What I want to believe.
I guess it's because I'm
Greener than green.
Only because I'm green.
Only because I'm green.

I came up to your floor
You were dressed
Just a little obscene.
And it shut me down
Quite sexually
Like a pre-adolescent
because I'm greener than green.

Only because greener then green.
Only because I'm green.

We like to spy on the neighbors.
They look so happy together.
Funny the power of strangers.
Sometimes I wonder if they got it better.
Green. Have you seen green?
Check out the view from the rooftop.
They've got a horse and a big trampoline.
Running and jumping till they drop.
Down on the ground and they're rolling around in... green.
Have you seen green?
Have you seen green grass?
So green, grass.
So green.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be moving on a lawn, so green.
I want to laugh the way they laugh.
See all my blues get back up in the sky.
If only we had what they had.
We'd never worry and we'd never cry for, green.
Have you seen green?
Have you seen grass?
So green, grass.
So green.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be moving on a lawn, so green.

Now, May and I were two children just swimming in a pool
We'd ride on rockets, swing-sets and we tried to touch the moon
And I will never forget the first time she touched my hand
I knew this could be the one who would make me an honest man

She was like the way she was
She was like the way she was

Now, we got older faster than we ever could have seen
Lights went down on graduation then on a wedding ring
We bought our first house and had a baby on the way
But during birth, I got my daughter
Jesus took away my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
When you looked into her eyes you'd come undone
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

Now, baby girls love daddy most
But they need a mother's care
I tried my best to raise her right
I just couldn't braid her hair
One day she got old enough to have her wedding day
But as I walked her down the aisle
All I could see was my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
When you looked into her eyes you'd see the sun
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

But May, I hope you can see what I see
'Cause when they talk about our baby girl they think of you
And they say to me

She's just like she was
When I looked into her eyes I'd see the sun
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And doesn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

She was just like she was
When I looked into her eyes I'd come undone
She was just like she was
And I cannot feel my heart beat
Without the thought of her inside me
She was like she was

We strolled along through the heaven
And it was June, June on the Isle of May
Your lips were sweet as the heaven
Love was in bloom there on the Isle of May

Cause in your arms heaven opened its door
Then like a fool I sailed away
But our love will bring us together
When it is June, June on the Isle of May

I see that worried look upon your face
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

Now just like you, I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

She used to love me, that I know
And it don't seem so long ago

That we were walking
And we were talking
The way that lovers do

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

And so forgive me if I seem unkind (I ain't got no pity for you)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine (I lost, I lost, I lost my little girl
Too)
I'd help another place, another time
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You've got your troubles, I've got mine.

Strangers in the night,
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night,
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.

How gentle is the rain, that falls softly on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

How gentle is the rain, that falls gently on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me;
And if your love is true, ev'rything will be just as wonderful.

You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me;

Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore

The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love

There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

Say it isn't so
Say it isn't so.
Everyone is saying you don't love me,
Say it isn't so.

Everywhere I go,
Everyone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,
Say it isn't so.

People say that you
Found somebody new,
And it won't be long before you leave me,
Say it isn't true.

Say that everything is still okay,
That's all I want to know.
And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.

People say passing by
Say he's younger than i
And it won't be long before you leave me,
Tell me it's a lie.

Say that everything is still okay,
That's all I want to know.
And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

(Come on and) dance with me
I want my arms about you
That those charms about you
Will carry me through

(Right up) to heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)

Out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh once I had a little dog, his color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,
Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, "My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine"

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too.
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear,
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Ring around the rosy
And I'll catch you if I can
And if you don't say may I,
Then you'll have to start again
But first you must indulge me
And count from one to ten
Let the game begin

I adore you when you touch me
Pin the tail upon the donkey,
You will surely win
And if you don't say may I,
Then I'll pass the cake around
And I won't give you any,
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat soap, anyhow

Red light, green light,
Blue light, yellow light
You can take three giant steps
Or a baby step will do
But if you don't say may I,
Then I'll march you out the door
Where you'll be contemplating
The numbers one to four
I hope you're keeping score

'Cause if you don't say may I,
Then I'll get you with the hose
And spoil your Sunday clothes
Will it please you if I tease you
While you're at the spindry,
I'll pass the pie around
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat blackbird anyhow

There's four and twenty reasons
Why it can't be wrong
How long have you been gone
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers

Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,

Yo, Step into reality, it's a cold cold world
You got to learn to accept it, feels like I've been neglected
All these bands coming out and they sound alright
All these videos on tv and they look alright
I spent my whole life spilling my guts between the lines
Putting in more work than you will ever know than when I rhyme
Tryin to press the people so I can reach the masses
Give them what they want with this pen that's plastic (Life)
I got a message I'm a put it in a bottle
Sign the bottom of the paper and let the whole world swallow
Today can be tomorrow, ain't no telling when I'm leaving
I'm a rock this microphone even when I'm barely breathin'
When you start sleepin, D-loc starts creepin
When you actin a fool, D-loc's always thinking
Be clever when you play me because it's comin back to hull
I can feel my heats rising and it's pissin me off
And when it's pissin me off I got no choice
But to crack snap back at you like a chain reaction
I'm gettin older dog you better watch your mouth
You better think before you speak on the mic or get knocked out
It's been a minute and your shit better stop
Bring your punk ass back to Cali, bitch ass get popped
You ain't never in Cali, wonder why they don't accept you
Your sound's getten flopped, plus you got a fuckin attitude

Life
Life's a constant struggle

I was never really understood, had a lot of misunderstandings
Not too many saw my plan, so it left me standing in my own two shoes
Now what the fuck was I suppose to do?
Givin a fight, be a man or take my life
To make ends meet I did more wrongs than rights
Couldn't hold a job, I can't handle being bossed
In and out of rehabs, from border schools I was tossed
Started hanging with the wrong crowd
Caught slanging by my pops and got thrown out
On my own once again I had to make it happen
That's just a little of my life before I started rappin'
But I always kept in touch with my dog Dustin
That's the one friend that I never stopped trusting
Next thing you know I'm living over at his pad
Me and him and Saint we was workin for his dad
Drinkin tallboys after work every night
Takin hits in the garage out of metal pipes
Working long ass hours no 9 to 5
But you gotta do what it takes to survive
That's around the time that we met Daddy X
And ever since then we've been on a new quest
Kottonmouth was formed so it began a new chapter
Of my life that I'm livin til I'm in the after after

Life
Everybody has troubles
And everybody's troubles are different than others
Life's a constant struggle
But keep your head high and it'll be alright
Life
Everybody has troubles
And everybody's troubles are different than others
Life's a constant struggle
But keep your head high and it'll be alright

Life
Everybody has troubles
"Think about it"
Life's a constant struggle
"Think about it"
Life
Everybody has troubles
"Think about it" "Think about it" "Think about it"
Life's a constant struggle
But keep your head high
And it'll be alright
"Think about it"

Did you see me fall away?
At what point did fate crumble to the ground?
I thought I found something to last forever.
Holding on with desperate tears,
I was screaming but you could not seem to hear me cry and now, I surrender.

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast.
Better off leaving with these last times
So you?ll keep remembering me.
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you keep remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Tell me was it good for you?
Cause its what kept me glued to what I knew all along was going in the wrong direction.
I don't think I gave up too early.
I don't think life is long enough to go and waste it all on imperfection

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast
Better off leaving with these last times
So you'll keep remembering me
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you're still remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Running on empty always
I swim to the surface always
But the truth is always hard to take
In broken pieces

Better think of something fast
Better off leaving with these last times
So you'll keep remembering me
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you keep remembering me forever. Remember me forever.
You'll remember me.

Just one short life
No second chance
To make of ourselves what we can
The moving hands again advance
& mould me into what I am
Waiting, waiting
Well understood but not controlled
Forever here anonymous
What's present now
Already past
In retrospect so obvious
Waiting, waiting
Such a short space of time
But time passes quickly
Learn so little so slowly
As each moment is mine
The hope never fading
You will always be left waiting, waiting
Such a short space of time
Learn so little so slowly
As each moment is mine
You will always be left waiting

Growing apart you couldn't see
Your not the man I want to be
Stale mate time it was over
All the while destroying each other
One thing I'd like you to know
I want my own life so let me go
All the years obeying the rules
Your game of life is played by fools
Just let me go, just let me fo
I can't feel nothing for you
But what is left for me to do
No cause for concern, we live & we learn
I'll just say goodbye
Search deep I have to find
The truth that lurks within my mind
Your words you used to drown me
Are washed away I'm free to be
Just let me go, just let me go
I can't feel nothing for you
But what is left for me to do
No cause for concern, we live & we learn
I'll just say goodbye
Now we're apart can you see
I'm now the man I want to be
A second chance not that its over
We don't need to hate each other
I can't feel nothing for you
But what is left for me to do
No cause for concern, we live & we learn
I'll just say goodbye (Repeat 2X)

Another day, you've no concerns but the desire burns
Another day, for you to face your problem
Is that the way that you want to be ?
A constant liability
Another day, why can't you see what you are gonna be
Another day, will pass away unnoticed
Your remedy for peace and quiet
Constant intake liquid fire
Good intentions permanent again
Another crisis imminent again
Your worst side dominant again
Look at yourself again
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
What do you see ?
Everything revolves around the habit
Like it or not it is the bottom line
Hand to mouth a single reflex you are mine
Detached from being forget your problems
No misgivings are you happy now ?
Good intentions permanent again
Another crisis imminent again
Your worst side dominant again
Look at yourself again
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
What do you see ?

It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy

And losin' touch with all that's real
Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover

Iron lung I know you well
Deal with you like a bad spell
See the trail moon burns
Red Stripe and Vicadin
You were the only one
You're the censor
You'll never people me
I'm not defenseless
In the afternoon as the light dims
Build a life out of, of all this Semtex
You're the brightest one
You were the center
The perfect opposite of, of what you asked for

It's not just one way
A negative factor
With all of these wasps out
I'd better take cover
Better take cover

Copper tongue beam me up
Lonely without my impediments
Start to save what we used to steal
Walking on gelatin
I never noticed you
You were the brightest one
You were the wide of me
Just like the English sun
You caught the light again
In a perfect way
The biggest threat of all
Is in the alleyway
You're the demon seed
You're the factor
Feel better with a little bit of plaster

It's not just one way
A negative factor
With all of these wasps out
Better take cover
Better take cover
I'd better take cover

There's all the pain in the way she talks
All the pain in the way she walks
All the pain in her wave goodbye
All the pain in the way she smiles
All the pain in her fatal charm
All the pain in her arms
In her arms
In her arms
In her arms

Stuck in the learning hole,
There is no teaching
That I can subscribe to -
Just the hatred of being afraid.

Trapped in a nightmare,
Nothing can alter this.
Just another daydream,
Calendar sadness.

Lucid, inducing swarm
Becoming closer but getting colder.
The caustic grip insane.

Lucid induced
Pre-shaping destiny - hiding inside of me.
Primate illusions of
How all this should be.

Next of kin to chaos.

Forgive the prince for awaking rude
He heard footsteps near his head
Lady luck had made him proud
When he spends his stays in bed
Making love to the victories
Wives just paying for his head (?)
Today will outlive yesterday
As long as someone breaks the bread
He's his mamma's pride
He's his daddy's last heartbreak

Well the sunrise in the kingdom
Chicken's swooned to hear the man (?)
Some find their way onto the paintings
Others calling to the frying pan
And the farmer's wife wakes him with smiles,
Tender budging hands
Meat and wine for all as long as someone breaks the land
Meat and wine for all. long as someone breaks the land
He's got his mamma's eyes
He's got his daddy's younger hands

Sunset makes the shadows longer
But the tavern in the valley glows
Stars fly on the forest, hell,
There's a prince hanging out the window
The farmer's daughter rubs his neck
Her hands are strong from serving rum
Today gonna outlive yesterday
Tonight gonna outlive yesterday
Tonight might make for kingdoms to come
Kingdoms yet to come
Kingdoms yet to come

Every night without the light
Or brightly shining low
Silver trees and darkened leaves
Blot the sky above

As the yellow moon to the darkest night
Turns to raging fire
The road it bends and the darkness spins
To voices in the choir

I dream of horses and their kin
Against the lovely night
I dream of sand and sky and sin
Against the pale blue light

And everyone that feels at all
Has got something to say
About the way of southern ways
Of every wild day

There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?

There's a little child runnin' 'round this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done now
How did you go bad?

Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

You see, I'm all grown-up now
He said
Just put your feet down child
'Cause you're all grown-up now

Just like a photograph I pick you up
Just like a station on the radio
I pick you up
Just like a face in the crowd
I pick you up
Just like a feeling that you're sending out
I pick it up
But I can't let you go
If I let you go
You slip into the fog

This love was big enough for the both of us
This love of yours
Was big enough to be frightened of
It's deep and dark like the water was
The day I learned to swim

Just put your feet down child
Just put your feet down child
The water is only waist high
I'll let go of you gently
Then you can swim to me

Big enough to let go of me?
Without hurting me

We'll dig a hole in the ground
And cover it up with sticks
And chase a wooly mammoth in
And jab at it with our spears

The lady at the counter
With cold oatmeal eyes,
'Take a number', she said,
'They'll call you when they're ready for you.'

I was waiting for
My hunting with early man license
They said it costs one hundred bucks
Can you believe it?

We'll dig a hold in the ground
And cover it up with sticks
And chase a wooly mammoth in
And jab at it with our spears...

They said it cost one hundred bucks,
Can you believe it?

The lady at the counter
With cold oatmeal eyes!

We dropped the ball,
It rolled away,
Down a hill,
Onto the freeway,
We didn't look,
We got run over,
We died and rotted
We decomposed.
We became fuel
For future human
Flying cars
Our remains
Will quench their
Thirsty engines
They'll get gas
Or die trying...
We swallowed the olive, man, we blew it...
We Baptized our Super-Sized Babies in embalming fluid...
With squirt guns...

We dropped the ball
It rolled away
Behind the couch
It gathered dust
The soot of lives
We put our feet up
On the table
Which was embossed
With dead skin
The soot of lives
We were scared
We bought plastic
Furniture covers
And jogging suits
To protect us from the bulldozers

Jesus Christ is my American Idol!
He's the Brand New Funky President!
Victory is certain, this much is certain,
And if it's not you can always
Start the video game over....

Squirt Guns filled with pig's blood, for real

We're winning...

Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York
My baseball mitt collects dust on the floor of my car.
And I sort of secretly hope he's not there to stay...
But anyway...
I hope Sam's a famous actor one day...

Sometimes I dream I'm driving across the water
In a car with my dad or my brother...
Sometimes you dream you're in a foreign country
And you packed all the wrong clothes...

Cars up on the overpass
Fake the sound of waves
I can feel the building shaking
Pacing pacing pacing pacing

By the bedroom window
Spying dirty eating urban birds...
Picking myself apart
Waiting for you to get home from work...

Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York
I don't know what to do with do-nothing days
I suppose there's no such thing anymore anyway...
I suppose that's okay...

Cars up on the overpass
Fake the sound of waves
I can feel the building shaking
Pacing pacing pacing pacing

I will not hide inside
Bewilderment...

On a drizzling day
Monks and drums and cats
And our hats mussed our hair
And our shaking frames
Found their wedded way...

Different ways to learn
What you ought not not do-
Different paths to the same places...Edit as you go...
Life on the first take

Walking on guilelessness's sturdy stilts
Through guiltlessness's beaming streets

I'm a tiny Crab
In a tidal wave
I have no complaints
And I too have you
To complain about it to.

Walking on guilelessness's sturdy stilts
Through guiltlessness's beaming streets
To see you naked outdoors...
With Rousseau eyes

Erase erase erase
Silent explosions in space
Erase erase erase
Pure as the sun on your face

Erase erase erase
Until there ain't a trace
Pure as the sun on your face

One day I'll seethe with ether teeth...
One day we'll breathe a coelacanth tree...
One day history will be but a tickling breeze.

I'm a total wreck when you don't call
Fancy me a brand new Newton sitting
Under an anvil tree
Waiting for an anvil to fall

They call me Mr. It's A Big Deal
I don't ever go to movies
So when I go to movies
It's a pretty big fucking deal

Flop like a fish on a dock
Conk me with a frying pan to make me stop

Clothes in a dryer
Leaves in the breeze
One day a dump trunk will dump two tons of kittens on me

After dark
All bark no bite
At night
All bite no bark

We are warm where we are...
I am totally fucking prepared to declare nuclear war on every boy in every band...

Aw Crud, what a dud
A fuddy duddy
That's funny, that mummy

I hate you wall
I'm sorry wall
I didn't mean that at all.

A Maroon
With a harpoon
In a spitoon
In a saloon
A cartoon moon

The end of the movie reel- flap, flap flap
The wings of the pterandodon- flap, flap, flap
A big fat, pregnant, radish smiling
At the funniest pallbearer in the funeral.

The eye, a spoof of god.
The day, a crippled wolf.
Were you born to be a sprinkler system in a thunderstorm?

We can agree that we all like to look our best.
Or at the very least be the best at looking the worst.
It's no wonder that eventually we will all be on TV.

Woke up and smiled this morning
Wishes swam like fishes in my head
I rub my eyes as all the reasons chase the
Demons from my bed
I'm on top of the world
And it's just for a moment

I know all the right words
And I wish that I'd told you then
I know now, I know how
Come and splash in the waves and they'll kiss you with cold
'Till you shiver and say that you wish I would hold you
Well I know now

I know how
Woke up and smiled this morning
Wishes swam like fishes in my head
I rubbed my eyes as all the reasons chase the
Demons from my head
Open goals that call me over
I've got to take them
Don't fall over again

General guidelines to ride by
Can't kill my vibe, you couldn't find mine
Come to New York City, I'm in the skyline with a fine dime
And nigga we ain't fine dining
Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates
Hit the high line, that's a cheap date
I ain't worthy, fuck it who is?
Do what you do girl, fuck it you lit
Hundred niggas yelling "New York back"
I hear em rapping they only set, "New York back"
I'm in Queens to Harlem, the Garden I rap
And I'm only hearing New York clap
Bout to move out to Cali, got a little thing out the valley
And this one girl hiding my hookah
I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver
Truth, through the city like a presidential motorcade
On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake
Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A
Running with the same niggas since grade eight
You ain't never seen no strangers appear
My niggas been the same ones for years
I don't do it for the peers, I do it for the fam
Man, all of my angles are clear
Other day yo, I was shopping on Rodeo
Got a call from my nigga Cheyo
Said the hood hot bro
Gotta get away yo
Losing niggas like every day
Told 'em 18 months I'ma get a tour bus
Coming up and we never looking back
Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep
Three ducks in the truck like beep beep

Life is what you make of it, it's play-doh
This year, this year man goes back to the moon

If you coming to my city wanna know the deets?
I'm the embassy, I'm the one to see
Yeah baby, yeah baby
From over here but I took it over there baby
Riding in the drop, let your hair crazy
Climbing to the top going stair crazy
Crazy how the game opened up
A nigga ain't been home for some months
But when I get home I be posted up
Do it for the city til the coast is us
From a city where a nigga turn a penny to a twenty
But when the penny turns friends turn to enemies
As semis turn urns into memories
Make shots nigga burn like the Hennessy
The city got problems, the city's so godless
I watch it all burn like it's heresy
Witchcraft for your bitchass, witchcraft is your gift that
I live in the moment, the moment is timeless
I hear all your talk but you're so unaccomplished
Opinions are nonsense
And I ain't got time for opinions to process
These days I'm inspired by me and nothing else
Bottles of tequila and some weed and nothing else
You know my niggas with me and no one else
I ain't pressing you can hold them hoes, sudden death
Golden goals

You know where I come from
You know my story
You know why I'm standing here
Tonight
Please don't go
Don't be in a hurry

Make it right

Well I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more

Worth reaching for

You know that I need you

Live without you
Be without you

That we will be leaving together
So when I say I love you

Ever and ever

Tonight
Please don't go
Don't be in a hurry

Make it right

Well I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more

Live without you

Well I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more
No more

I'm not here to say I'm sorry
I'm not here to lie to you

If you want to sing
Then sing
If you want to run
Run away
It's all right to speak
Just watch what you say
Don't let the words
Get in your way
To achieve
All you've got to do is just believe
Come whatever, come what may, sing

I can't let my dreams slip away
I won't let my heart break
It doesn't matter what it takes
I'm reaching for my goal
I'm going on
If you're on the team
Come to play
Be the one
That sets the pace
Follow your dreams
Dream away
And your life
Will never be the same
To achieve
All you've got to do is just believe
Come whatever, come what may

[Chorus 2x]
With every passing day
Until I'm old and gray
I'm gonna do my thing
No matter what my so called friends might say
They can't put out my fire
I've got too much desire
I'm reaching for my goal
Can you help me, can you help me sing
Vamp out

I had me a wearied dream, seen me a wearied scene
When I seen what I saw, couldn't sit still
Nero was kissing on Buffalo Bill
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me

There was rhinestone whips and midgets
Quasimodo was jerking in hard
I seen a tribe of pygmies doing their thing
Riding in on Saint-Bernards

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me
Whew!

There was Shetland ponies and bulldogs
Jockstraps and cowboy boots
Forty-seven miles of tennis shoe tongue
And thirteen pair of shoes

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me

Let it roll!

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me

I had me a wearied dream, seen me a wearied scene

Bracing myself for that tough spot
Just when I'm sure about what I got
No time to be wasted on the back stroke
I'm looking back on all the things that you broke
So far, so good, so what for?
It's slacking up, but you might not cut it
So far, so good, so what for?
It's growing up, you just can't slow it down
And that's a sure thing
Use what you learned to get up and face another day
Taking your time to get your feet wet
Sometimes you gotta jump in or you'll never see, never
Win
You want to go,
You move to slow
Saving up for nothing that you show or never know

So far, so good, so what for?
It's slacking up, but you might not cut it
So far, so good, so what for?
It's growing up, you just can't slow it down
And I don't know what's in store
But it's so good, so far
And that's a sure thing
And that's a sure thing
Take your time, 'cause you wanna make it
Turn up right in everyway
Make a choice if you're gonna make it
Not for nothing,
You've just gotta reach out your hand
And it's there
You've just gotta reach out your hand

In this state of grace
I'm sick and tired of falling
I want to do the right thin
But it always ends up such a mess
It's just another mix-up your expectations met
You stake your claim to failure
Then that's just what you'll be
Just what you get and so

What do you want to make of?
What do you have to work with?
A second guess is worthless
You get just one chance to go around don't you?
In this state of grace
In this state of trust
In what's in store for me

Putting on an act that just isn't working
You stole from your friends when you thought they weren't looking
Your whole fucking life, you put on a front
You pushed it to the point when my trust slips through your hands
Trust
You don't understand
Trust
Slips through your hands
Oh thought you were the one
It's what you haven't got

Try to play it cool
Why be something that you're not?
It's just the fucking point that you steal, that you miss
You pushed it to the point when my trust slips through your hands
Trust
You don't understand
Trust
Slips through your hands
Trust
Slips through your hands

What you think you don't say out loud
You're too busy following the crowd
Critisized for the things you said
You can't lead if your being lead
I won't drown
Gang opinion, it keeps you down
You can't believe it
The friends you found they'll chew you up and spit you right the fuck out
I can't imagine just what you think
Choke on approval, you don't even drink
Keep walking into the same old walls
Have a nice trip,
I'll see you next fall
I won't drown
Gang opinion, it keeps you down

I can't believe it
The friends you found
Like at a dead end street, and you're along for the ride
Where will it end?
You can't see the brick wall
You don't know, but you're headed for it
And is it easy to go through the pressure that weighs you down so far
And you know it
And when you look back and you see all the chances that you missed
Will you regret it?
It's on your shoulders now
You've gotta bear it,
Or will you fold?
That your opinion doesn't count for shit

There was a time when I washed out with the tide that came in your opinion
I second guessed what I knew was right
It was just to please and so I did it as a friend
In need of friends, what I'm looking for

'Cause it won't cut it anymore
Take a seat and watch
It counts too much
It's your decision, so what are you gonna do?

I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice
And I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice

The trouble when you go with the flow, you might set yourself up to give
Out more than you can
A situation that'll come your way,
Something you don't approve, but you couldn't see

And you're right if you're feeling bad
Lose yourself following a fad
So stick around with who you found will listen to what you gotta say
And is it easy?

I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice
And I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice

And everyone's not looking for approval
Sometimes you gotta go it alone
Don't work too hard being normal
Just work hard on what you want

So I don't need you to make my choices
I don't need you to make my choices
I don't need you to make my choices!
Make my choices

I don't need you to make my choices!

We can see the problems
But what'd you do to solve them
Talking without action
What's the difference
Something to believe in
Following your lead
It's time to pick a side not sit on a fence
It won't cut it

You wanna talk about the kids united
Take a swing at the upper hand
You wanna talk about the kids united
And this world it won't just listen

What's the situation
An un-united nation
Working for a slave wage
What would you pay?
Kicking down a closed door
Something you could fight for
It's time to pull up your head off the floor
We're standing up
You can't keep us down
We'll stick tight
You can't push us around
There's no limit to what we can do
We're gonna take it
To a level where they've got to tell the truth

It's gonna take our strength to lift it
This weight can't hold us down
Our pack solid and bonded
Open minded pushing forward
Making changes, our own choices

Try to make this scene your home
But you just can't seem to leave the kids alone
Beat down for standing up to you
It's coming back around
I'm telling the truth

Go home!
This is not your soundtrack for violence

Violence

Some people might look up to you
Maybe they have a fucking problem too
This time I'll forget my fear
It's not your song and we're making it clear

Go home!
This is not your soundtrack for violence

Sold up the river while you were asleep
A bored little watching MTV
Your days in the sun got no end in sight
It's all family fun?
Another family fight it's your

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive for the remote control
We don't care
It's a boring summer
Taking a dive we don't care
We 'll change this
People in the window watching people like you
Both looking for nothing
And you haven't got a clue
There's a world outside, join it sometime
Think you're stepping out
But you're standing in line

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive we don't care
You can't change this
Don't come to the door it's like you aren't around
Can't hear a knock over the TV sound get down
Stationary in an easy chair
Your summer is over and the trees are bare
Kiss it goodbye?your days in the sun
Comfort in the country
'Cause you're not the only one

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive for the remote control
We don't care
It's a boring summer
It's a boring summer

Boring summer
Boring summer
Boring summer
Boring summer

In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night

Stock in my seat can't move no way the other guys knows the game to play
I'm watchin' her
I'm watchin' me
I'm gettin' brave

Oh
Take him apart say listen to me.
Look on the floor and all is spinning round

Someone told me this was just a dance

And take a chance ain't met before
Do you think I really have a chance?
Hypnotic tango
Tango
Tango!

Rough diamond he smiles
She looks at him

Ain't gonna be
No story in love

Take me to the dance
Floor by the hand

Give me this night
In a foreign land.
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Hypnotic
Hypnotic

Hypnotic
Hypnotic
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is sinning round

Now won't you listen honey, while I say,
How could you tell me that you're goin' away?
Don't say that we must part,
Don't break your baby's heart

You know I've loved you for these many years,
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears?
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.

Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too.
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear,
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.

Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street

You were changin' colours like the leaves in fall
I was savin' up for the long winter
Summers wind, hideout in my car
When it broke down we didn't care
We'd figure out another way to get me there

Mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours

A realistic love runs out of room
I try to talk big but my mouth don't move
Cuz I don't own the sun I don't own the moon
They only come out when they want to
They don't care whether I promised you
They only come out when they want to
They don't care whether I promised

What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours

You wanna fight about it
You wanna fight about it
You wanna fight about it
Come on, Come on
I made you cry about it
I made you cry about it
I made you cry about it
Come on, Come on
There was no other way
To let you in here to stay
We had to give it away
Come on, Come on
And when we come up for air
And when we come up now we know

All my stones become your pearls
All of my trials are your treasures

All my dead you inherit
All of my?crimson? lines will shine

Cuz Mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours is yours is yours is yours

Stock in my seat can't move no way the other guys knows the game to play

Oh
Take him apart say listen to me.
Look on the floor and all is spinning round

Someone told me this was just a dance

And take a chance ain't met before
Do you think I really have a chance?
Hypnotic tango
Tango

Rough diamond he smiles
She looks at him

Ain't gonna be
No story in love

Take me to the dance
Floor by the hand

In a foreign land.
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Hypnotic
Hypnotic

Hypnotic
Hypnotic
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is sinning round

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say "Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch?"
The moment I could see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the "Goodbye"
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now

Mine love is mine
Whether it rain or storm or shine
Mine you are mine
Never another valentine

And I am yours tell me that I'm yours
Show me that smile my heart adores
Mine more than divine
To know that love like yours is mine

Mine, love is mine
Whether it rain or storm or shine
Mine, you are mine
Never another valentine

And I am yours tell me that I'm yours
Show me that smile my heart adores
Mine, more than divine
To know that love like yours is mine

Mine is a heart
That beats for only you
Mine is a love that always will be true
For ever more, beyond the end of time
I will be your love, promise you'll be mine

Mine is a heart
That beats for only you
Mine is a love that always will be true
For ever more, beyond the end of time
I will be your love, promise you'll be mine

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet
But when the boats have gone
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
If you fancy we can buy an ice cream cone
Your mate has gone she didn't want to be alone
I will pounce on you, just us and the cuckoos
You are helpless now
Over and over we flatten the clover
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass
Grass, (on) grass
Things we did on grass

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet
But when the boats have gone
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
If you fancy we can buy an ice-cream cone
Your mate has gone
She didn't want to be alone
I will pounce on you
Just us and the cuckoos
You are helpless now
Over and over we flatten the clover
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass
Grass, grass.
Things we did on grass

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet
But when the boats have gone
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
If you fancy we can buy an ice-cream cone
Your mate has gone
She didn't want to be alone
I will pounce on you
Just us and the cuckoos
You are helpless now
Over and over we flatten the clover
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass
Grass, grass.
Things we did on grass

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room in the colourful way

And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

The leaves of grass will not pass on
Though the millstones grind them into dust
For the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

And the brave must fall to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

If people could look into each other's eyes
What a wonderful place this world would be
All strife would end, we could start again
And dreams like these must not pass on

But the brave keep falling to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

And the brave keep falling to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

The leaves of grass will not pass on
Though the millstones grind them into dust
For the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

I'm not in this town to stay
Said a lady old and grey
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your clothes
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

I will pawn you my watch
I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

When those gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed kissed her baby boy and then she died
Yes, warden, in the arms of her dear boy there she died
Yes, warden, in the arms of her dear boy there she died






As silver tears they weave and lace,
Sad patterns upon her face,
She waits for you.
So low below a laser sun,

Through velvet fields she runs,
Reaching for you.
And so you bleed now,
Your hand holds the knife

That is tearing your life apart.
Why don't you leave now,
The city's too heavy
And your dreams they melt in the sun.

On mellow blue, birds curve and glide.
Through shadows of grief she slides,
She waits for you.
There on a hill before the dawn,

In silence a promise torn,
She turns from you.
And so you bleed now ...
As silver tears, they weave and lace,

She waits for you.
So low below a laser sun,
Reaching for you.
On mellow blue birds curve and glide.

She waits for you.
There on a hill before the dawn,
She turns from you...

Groovy day,
A sunny day,
Walking through the country.

Just a breeze,
And I feel at ease,
Walkin' through the country.

Blades of grass,
Playin' with my feet,
And there's nothing so sweet,
As the way you treat me.

Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country!

Singing!

Ohhh, feelin' good, Baby

I know there's someone,
Someone who needs you.
Walkin' through the country together,
And love's gonna,
Come to you.

Oh, what a groovy, groovy day,
A sunny day.
Walkin' through the country.

Just a breeze,
And I feel at ease,
Walkin' through the country.

Blades of grass,
Playin' with my feet,
There's nothing so sweet,
As the way you treat me.

Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country,
You're walkin' through the country!

Singing!

Keep walkin' through the country, baby.
Feels good now, doesn't it?
Walkin' through the country

Glory Bound
Grass Roots

All the sun on the outside
Doesn't touch what I feel within
When I've got you beside me
I'm reachin' out for the rainbow's end
You get to me and give me a feelin' that's comin' on
Gettin' stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
Glory bound to that everlastin' feelin'
Glory bound, oh I'm never never comin' down

I'm lookin' out on a sky of gray
I don't care, let the rains come
If I'm with you it's a sunny day
You make me feel so close to heaven
Whenever I'm beside you

[Chorus]

I need the comfort I see in your smile
I need the touch of your hand
Come on and bring out the best in me, girl
Don't you know that you can

[Erick Sermon]
And you don't quit
Yeah  pioneers one time (one time  two times)
Yeah  Erick Sermon boy

[Parrish Smith]
Yeah  we rap  where you at? (mic check)
"Check this out!"
Hey yo who want to step up and get their cranium cracked
From my man Louis from the Ville Slugger baseball bat
Cock back gats, cause rugged apparel's where it's at

So stand back, we flash a nine before the jack and squeeze triggers
Blazin' at one hit wonder niggas like Smoothe Da Hustler
I still sneak over and fuck your babysitter
No quitter, microphone's my transmitter
Which clocks figures, in return, the track's the Gold Digger

[Erick Sermon]
Huh me? I buy ice for no one
Rap shogun, so I bought myself a gun
Yeah Dunn, ain't the one to be steppin' to son
I agree with Slick Rick, you cats is crumbs
My squad gets Dumb and Jim Carrey you ought the buildin'
Messin' around with God's children
I take action, like film crews
You against me, face to face, you'll lose!

Here comes two big pioneers, Rolex watches
Cars by the pairs, in stock we got shares
"That's right!"
Legendary, hardcore be-boy is the pedigree

[Erick Sermon]
P and I don't stop, we don't quit, who's seein' em?
On tracks, we Ruff Ryde like D and them
Then case the joint, like an agent, that's secret
Cats hate, so we on point frequent
E keep it decent, had to smack a dude recent
Right down the block, from the precinct
See you a punk, that talk too lenient
When I speak to a motherfucker, I MEAN IT!

[Parrish Smith]
So Open Sesame, and let down the main gate
But before you scream EPMD, you should wait
Cause we roll with a posse, from Strong Long to Canarsie
QBC, Boogie Down Bronx, back to Marcy
Pass that kiko, I drop a verse that sound slick yo
And your chick know, P's hungry, like the hippos
Suck on no nipples, but duck cats, quick to stick you
Like a pin-up, workin' out, and doin' chin-ups

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
Huh, hey yo my style flows, say it liquidates
It's best when it hits the beat and catch the breaks
Two time felon, fuck aroud with me
And my man pussycat and catch two to the melon!

[Parrish Smith]
Then I be like, "Yep yep," just like Teddy, Raw like Eddie
Sweaty, when I hold shit down and bake like Betty
And when I want things to move, I blink like Bewitched
To handle shit in the dark, red lights, with the laser hit

[Chorus]

Oh Pioneer, I sing your song
Well it's the hymn of those who've gone before and those who carry on
Pioneer, your work is hard
But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart

Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Oh Pioneer
So young and brave
Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
Pioneer, you orphaned child
Your mother is adventure and your father is the wild

Where are we going, oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

I won't run when bullets chase me
I won't rest where arms embrace me
I will love when people hate me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
Send the dark but it won't break me
You can try but you can't change me
Take my life, they will replace me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
I won't hush, no we will sing
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

Oh Pioneer, I sing your song
Well it's the hymn of those who've gone before and those who carry on
Pioneer, your work is hard
But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart

Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Oh Pioneer
So young and brave
Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
Pioneer, you orphaned child
Your mother is adventure and your father is the wild

Where are we going, oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

I won't run when bullets chase me
I won't rest where arms embrace me
I will love when people hate me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
Send the dark but it won't break me
You can try but you can't change me
Take my life, they will replace me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
I won't hush, no we will sing
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

When I was a young boy
I wanted to sail around the world
That's the life for me, living on the sea
Spirit of a sailor, circumnavigates the globe
The lust of a pioneer, will acknowledge no frontier
I remember you by, thunderclap in the sky
Lightning flash, tempers flare,
'round the horn if you dare
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Lucky just to keep afloat

Aotearoa, rugged individual
Glisten like a pearl, at the bottom of the world
The tyranny of distance, didn't stop the cavalier
So why should it stop me, I'll conquer and stay free
Ah c'mon all you lads, let's forget and forgive
There's a world to explore, tales to tell back on shore
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Six months in a leaky boat

Ship-wrecked love can be cruel
Don't be fooled by her kind
There's a wind in my sails
Will protect and prevail
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Nothing to it leaky boat.

Reachin' for a space in time, layin' our fate on the line
Starting out a life anew, after we've come so far
Won't you look and see now, here we are

You were the ones, there is no doubt
You ate it up and spit it out
You were the ones, you made it clear, you could take it
We are the sons of the pioneers (we are the sons of pioneers)
The day has come, our fate is clear
We're the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
We're not afraid to try (we're not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear

What's the point of going on, if you feel that it couldn't be done
Cause I just wanna understand, freedom's the soul of a man
Won't you look and see now, and show me how

We have the chance, there is no doubt
We'll pick it up, and see it out
We are the ones, you made it clear, we can take it
We are the sons of the pioneers (we are the sons of pioneers)
The day has come, the way is clear
For the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear......................fear

When you think of how far we've come, and to know that we've only begun
Leaving us a legacy, makes sense to me
That now our time has come, for we have to move on

You were the ones, there is no doubt
You ate it up and spit it out
You were the ones, you made it clear, you could take it
And now it's time, our fate is surely here now
There is no doubt about it, it's time we thought about it
We are the ones, the way is clear, for the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afriad of fear

Is there any doubt, none at all, they heard the call of the
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear

Control
If it can be broke then it can be fixed, if it can be fused then it can be split
It's all under control
If it can be lost then it can be won, if it can be touched then it can be turned
All you need is time

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

A sense of purpose and a sense of skill, a sense of function but a disregard
We will not be the first, we won't
You said you were going to conquer new frontiers,
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world, we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

Breath in, breath out

If it can be broke then it can be fixed, if it can be fused then it can be split
It's all under control
If it can be lost then it can be won, if it can be touched then it can be turned
All you need is time

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

A sense of purpose and a sense of skill, a sense of function but a disregard
We will not be the first, we won't
You said you were going to conquer new frontiers,
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world, we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

Breath in, breath out

So here we are reinventing the wheel
I'm shaking hands with a hurricane
It's a colour that I can't describe,
It's a language I can't understand
Ambition, tearing out the heart of you
Carving lines into you
Dripping down the sides of you

We will not be the last.

If it can be broke then it can be fixed, if it can be fused then it
Can be split
It's all under control
If it can be lost then it can be won, if it can be touched then it
Can be turned
All you need is time

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?


A sense of purpose and a sense of skill, a sense of function
But a disregard
We will not be the first, we won't
You said you were going to conquer new frontiers,
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

Breath in, breath out

So here we are reinventing the wheel
I'm shaking hands with a hurricane
It's a color that I can't describe,
It's a language I can't understand
Ambition, tearing out the heart of you
Carving lines into you
Dripping down the sides of you

We will not be the last.

Dismiss the telegram
This is no exhibition
A pile of papers that are bound and tethered
We know the end of man will stem
From stale tradition
Relaying opinions
Changing like the weather

And this will never be and this will never be reversed
An installation
Sending an open invitation
To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone and
We keep wishing for a new frontier
Out of their teeth and bones
Forget what you thought you believed in

The plans we execute are far between and few
But I'll go around the world just for something to do
Existence is fleeting
You spend your life dreaming
The shores are exhausted
The time is receding

And this will never be a
And this will never be reversed
An installation
Sending an open invitation
To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone
And we keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in
And forget what you thought you believed in

And those who resisted
Were dragged out form there homes
This necklace was fashioned from their teeth and bones
And those who resisted
Were dragged out from their homes
This necklace was fashioned from their teeth and bones
Their teeth and bones

To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone and
We keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in
And forget what we you thought you believed in

Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting

Here where we stand there used to be a forest
A timber rising endlessly before us
We cleared away that God forsaken jungle
And in return the Indians adore us

What was mud now is a highway
Reaching wide into a prairie
Horses run cattle are grazing
You would swear it was Oklahoma

Day by day dark is illuminated
God's mistake altered and uncreated
Wrong's made right left to the jungle pioneer

See in the field my little son and daughter
Not long ago that ground was underwater
Now you can see them walking with the cattle
Singing them songs before they go to slaughter

There are those who would appose us
Crying out, "God save the planet"
Bleeding hearts can't turn assunder
This the eighth and final wonder

Day by day this land is liberated
God's mistake altered and uncreated
Wrong's made right left to the jungle pioneer

Saddle up giddy up and ride on out of here
We got a mile of burning to do today
Get along now gonna need you out of here
We got a pile of earning to do today

Down in Brazil there used to be a forest
Now in it's place a crazy wind is whistling
As every tree was falling in the forest
It made a sound but nobody was listening

When the last is buried under
What has been will be no longer
No matter what man may endeavor
Eden's gate closes forever

Day by day life is eliminated
God's own work altered and eliminated
Through it all there stands the jungle pioneer

It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember,
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, "Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that
Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, "Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."





You keep telling me yes
But you don't mean it
You keep telling me no
And try to lean it
You're giving me buts and maybe
You know this will drive me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no

You wear a plastic smile
I know by you eyes
You speak with indefinite style
You're telling me lies
You've got to face reality
What is wrong with you and me
Why can't you free your honesty

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no

Yes I know, know your love is gone
And you feel, you can't carry on
The burden gets heavier
And your sorrows are deeper, girl

You've got to give a little, take a little
Pay the price, make a sacrifice
Give a little, take a little
True love's a game if you give and take

Remember Romeo and Juliet
How they gave and took a lot, don't you forget
I know it's so hard to believe
But be smart and you won't have to fear

You've got to give a little, take a little
Pay the price, make a sacrifice
Give a little, take a little
True love's a game if you give and take

Yes, you'll say you haven't lost your faith
You'll get tired of this long wait
You must give if you want to get
If you do that you know you won't regret

The requested track is not viewable.

This could be asking for more than I merit
This could be testing your patience
I really don't have a whole lot to draw from
But I'd be willing to learn, only

Don't expect much style & finesse
But don't be surprised if I impress
I say this even though I'm almost sure by now you know

I say this even though I'm almost sure by now you know

Well way out west where the wild wind blows the eagle flies and the sage brush grows
Traditions are holding on you'll be glad to hear
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
Like that young cowboy from old Montana got boots and spurs and a black bandana
He rides the wild prairie rounding up the steers
Just like his Daddy he's a son of The Pioneers
From Texas clear up the Idaho from the mountains to the plains
They got the blood of Crockett and Geronimo flowing through their veins
Now the wild old west is changing some but traditions persevere
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
[ piano - fiddle ]
There's a gal down in Texas with a great big hat
She likes roping and dancing and things like that
And if you need a hand at your branding she'll volunteer
She's a wild prairie flower and a daughter of the Pioneers
He's got braids and hat with an eagle feather
He rides with broncs there ain't none better
And his great grandaddy was a chief on the wild frontier
And he's a proud son of the original Pioneers
Well from Texas clear up the Idaho...
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers

Enter the Wu-Tang zone

We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella

Enter the Wu-Tang zone

I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, 4 plus 4, but 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs

Pioneer the frontier

Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?

You enterin' the 36, masterin' the 18
[?] chamber sixth, hands down, I crush bricks
Backs that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal strikin' attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shallow steppin' ninja

Pioneer the frontier

What a weepin' and wailin' dung a Caymanas park
What a weepin' and wailin' dung a Caymanas park
Long Shot, him kick de bucket

Start with colors
They always get away with attitude
But they'll try to convince you of your mood
And what you want they'll give it to you
But it's only therapy, that's all they do

And for a year she was anti-pioneer
Singing sappy songs
About what went wrong

Two years before, but even now
When the false is true
When I call me you

When the flag changes colors
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go
When the flag changes colors

The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go

Anti-pioneer then
Anti-pioneer then
Anti-pioneer then
Anti-pioneer then

And for a year she was anti-pioneer

They passed her off too late
To change her future's fate
But even now when the false gets true
And living colors seem possible to you

When the flag changes colors
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go

When the flag changes colors
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go home

Sometimes I feel I've been here forever
Sometime ago
Sometimes we sense the doubt together
Sometimes alone

I'm tired but we won't sleep at all
Even though the air is calm
There's something here it's something warm
Something cuts and scars inside tonight

Sons of pioneers are hungry men

Every voice I hear sounds so familiar
Every song I know
Still there's been no change in the weather
But sometime we'll have to go

I'm tired but we won't sleep at all
Even though the air is calm
There's something here it's something warm
Something cuts and scars inside tonight

Sons of pioneers are hungry men

There's a storm coming up and I gotta prepare myself
'Cause this feeling's getting stronger everyday
Somethings creeping inside
Everything is about to change
Gotta face the fact that I can't walk away

This critical, I am feeling helpless
So hysterical, and this can't be healthy
I can't even sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe

This is critical, yeah
So stuck on you

Used to have everything figured out
But it's different now
When you came, you saw
You conquered my heart

It's your laugh and your smile
Wanna stay for a little while
I don't wanna go
I just want you in my arms

This critical, I am feeling helpless
So hysterical, and this can't be healthy
I can't even sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe

This is critical, yeah
So stuck on you

Used to run and hide
Used to bend our love
But I can't escape this time
Oh no

This critical, I am feeling helpless
So hysterical, and this can't be healthy
I can't even sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe

Yo checkout the superb tech
Cashin' checks through dialect
Doper than the gold around your neck
This is my manuscript to spit lyrics like fat spliffs
I show the whole damn world my gift
For Paris I'm speakin' upon
Powerful just like a pod
Positioned in the proper placement
Focus like militant deep as concentrational caverns
Devising secret plans on spitting atoms
I verbalize
Lust to bust
Just as dangerous
As watching Mt. Vesuvius erupt
Corrupt a data disk
From the super soul powered slums
I-N-I, Planet Asia make it bump, bump
I'm deep off in the trunk
SWATS call it crunk
The 15 inch woofers make the beat go thump
I dump clips of pros ? goes
The chillin' is killin' with the illest type flows

[Hook]
"Rap legends presidents felt" -> Nas 'Nas is Like'
"Put us together" -> Mobb Deep 'Survival of the Fittest'
"The outcome is Critical" -> GZA/Genius
"Set it off" -> Jeru The Damaja 'Mental Stamina'

[Zion I]
Yo, vocally blessed to beat you into submission
I paddle units which protrude from the underside of trains
Do not touch I'm high voltage
Like the third electric
Emergency phones needed in every tunnel for the murder method
You're dealing with the armed forces
We wave warm torches
Through the trenches of the onslaughtness
? up next
I'm anticipated post my plan is to stay behind my every line stated
Deluxe, eon fluctuates what I pronunciate
Cold verses be lookin' out but y'all people got months to wait
Life as it is baby, Zion I got me flyin' high
My mind's inside music symbolic to I-N-I
This ain't the Sci-Fi Channel
We true and living legends of this beat freak committee
Clash Of the Titans through the vinyl
When we splash the Atlas with the rules of the game
We out the old school and came to drop a jewel on your brain

[Hook]

[Planet Asia]
My brother hit me on the game
Said that we original man
And we manifested here to spit slang
I thought a minute, and let it sink
Deep like the Titanic
We wider than the ocean of Atlantic
Pacifical mythical styles
In the west it's gettin' wild
I'm chillin' like the Sphinx upon the Nile
Reverberating
Why is you hatin' hip hop we creatin?
Across the desert sands we be bakin'
My melanin
The key to lock rock spots and flocks
Walk the rugged avenue with my be-Boy bop
It's evolution toss a pebble at the devil and smile
I'm rebellion while propelling freestyles

[Zion I]
From the bottom to the top I made a lot of em drop
Hip hop's the lifestyle of urban civilians and even cops
No it don't stop
Once again another classic fantastic rap shit
That'll make y'all MCs wanna practice
How to lock shit down like Daddy ?
I blaze mics for days
Hit the page light stage and burn Sage
Then engage
This ain't a faze or some played out gimmick
That's worth to ? for the fact
That most of y'all cat's is timid, vivid
Views of the do and don't don't apply,
To the uncompromising Planet Asia, Zion I
Worldwide renown
Zones of the chosen few
Verbal rhymes I cipher shots to leave holes in you

[Hook]

I live alone
I live alone and I like it
Some people live alone
They live alone and look it
But I'm on the roam
And I like it

Some people say
I've lost my reason
I don't give a damn
For opinions out of season
'Cause I'm on the roam
And I like it

Don't you go messin' with my heart again
Don't you go messin' with me

Situation critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah
Situation is critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah yeah, oh

Some people say
Some people think I'm crazy
I'm not the lonely boy
My memories aren't hazy
Since I'm on my own
And I like it

Don't you go messin' with my heart again
Don't you go messin' with me

Situation critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah
Situation is critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah yeah, oh

Don't you go messin' with my heart again
Don't you go messin' with me

Situation critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah
Situation is critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah

Situation critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah
Situation critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah yeah, oh

Arriving in boats, black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed, covered my head
But they're flushin' me out with a broom
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind
But she never got the feelin' to last
Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it
This is the critical mass
So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
This is the critical mass
Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall
Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas, we'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the critical mass
Time and space, is takin' me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day

Oh the tension's mounting
The pressure starts to show
All the men in haunting
Please don't let me go
(Don't go)
Try to free my body

These'll never break me

Free wheel to look at me
Condition critical
I'm feeling physical
Condition critical
Now I'm really cynical
The bells they are ringing
Or is it in my head
My nerves numb understanding
I'm falling out of bed
(Don't go)
So call it paranoia
(Don't go)
I don't see it that way
(Let's go)
You say I adore ya
(Hell no)
We're gonna rock they way
Condition critical
I'm feeling physical

Now I'm really cynical
Ooh ooh
Whips and chains
Don't feel no pain
What's so wrong
I think I'm going out of my head
Over heels
I can't feel
No pain, only pleasure
Get me out
Take me home
Can't you see my condition
Woo-woo-woo

Visions of you
In daylight I dream
Reflections in water
My love is a stream
Can't free the desire
The passion inside
I'm burning with fire
Waiting as the day turns into night

In your eyes! everything is clear
There's nothing more to fear
The love is in your eyes
Everything is clear
There's nothing more to fear
The love is in your eyes

Walking on water
Can't touch the ground
I reach for the sky
My life is a sound
It pumps through my mind
The voice that I hear
I've seen through your eyes
Now everything is clear

In your eyes! everything is clear
There's nothing more to fear
The love is in your eyes
Everything is clear
There's nothing more to fear
The love is in your eyes

Visions of you
In daylight I dream
Reflections in water
My love is a stream
Can't free the desire
The passion inside
I'm burning with fire
Waiting as the day turns into night

In your eyes! everything is clear
There's nothing more to fear
The love is in your eyes
Everything is clear
There's nothing more to fear
The love is in your eyes

[Kool Keith]
Well I'm the equalizer, known to be graphic
I clear static, breakin up traffic
Move, while I enter the groove
I'm on top, and happy to prove
to wack MC's who claim to be better than
No way I'm frankly more clever than
all of you, each and every one, my son
Pay close attention
I take your brain to another dimension
Hold it, mold it, shape it
You got a knife, yes I wanna scrape it
up and down, sideways, any way I can
be rude to you
But I'll rap and be crude to you
And eat up, toy ducks I beat up
I am the oven your brains I wanna heat up
Mega, supersonic degrees
I come around, roastin MC's
with fire, to burn the toy liar
Raw meat, turn the flame higher
Cook it, like a fish I'll hook it
For any beat, it's time that I took it
right, correctly to the top
with the rhythm and as your head bop
I'm hype, for the critical beatdown!

[Ced Gee]
I'm attacking them, my job is stacking them
For every rapper, must I be smacking them
once, or twice in the face
With rough beats, producin the bass
that blow out, cause power to go out
Inner spark, I'm ready to blow out
like this, altitude level
Reachin forth, stompin every devil
in sight, you might just wanna bite
My illusions, mental confusions
You're a mark, skulls I've been abusin
Losin, any rapper who follow me
Your girl loves me, now she wanna swallow me
Back up, move on to the rear
When I'm on the stage should be clear
Speakin, goin ear to ear
Places far, ducks would appear
for the countdown, so you wait to rhyme
and twist, stuttering, uttering
Parkay, margerine, everything butter
and another thing, you shoulda been a Muppet
A toy boy, a fake scream puppet
I'm takin titles, and punks better up it
to me, Ced Gee on the mic, and I'm hype
for the critical beatdown!

[Kool Keith]
Here's the K, combined the double-O
Swing in the L, I'm ready to go
as Keith, Rap General Chief Executive
plus exquisitive
Mandatory, capital statements
I am the teacher, preaching what makes sense
Class, you wasn't able to pass
For any germ or lice who come last
I'm boric, high computing acid
Get off the mic and won't you please pass it
to me, for a one-two check
Give me a pound and lots of respect
No hands, you dissapointing my fans
You on reverb, and talking to cans
Hello - how are you doing?
I come to wreck, and parties I'll ruin
with rhymes, pumpin up smoke
Diesel advances makin them choke
and cough up, the hard-headed I'll soften
spongee, then after that drink a ?
Roll the sess, the buddha with the ganji
Puff up, while I make tough stuff up
I'm Kool Keith, cold rippin MC's
I'm hype - for the critical beatdown!

Shhh quiet might piss somebody off
Like me motherfucker you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone

So how does it feel to know that someone's kid
In the heart of America has blood on their hands
Fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle
That insults his family's existence
Well, where I'm from we have a special
Salute that we aim high in the air
Towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers
(fuck you)

Shhh quiet might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy
Collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen worthless man
(there's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(right this way you've dug your own grave)

I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone

All the way from the east to the west we
Got this high society
Looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every
Direction and blaming their
Own nation for who wins the elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing to the
Country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Mind snapped thoughts of death
Demented voices in his heaad
Chainsaw victim covered in blood
Severed body left for dead

Bloody killing spree
Brain fried eternally
Psychotic mission of death
Critical madness
Self inflicted pain
Slicing his face to shreds
Brutal blow to the face
Sentenced to death
By a swing of a mace
Blown out brains with a grenade
Hallucinating brain decayed

Violent breakdown
Truth of dare
Cut your flesh to the bone
No hope for a normal life

Insane asylum is your home





You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Til you heard the voices in your ear

Hey, it's me again
Plain to see again
Please can I see you every day

I'm a fool again
I fell in love with you again
Please can I see you every day

You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Til you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Til you heard the voices in your ear

Words don't come out right
I try to say it oh so right
I hope you understand my meaning

Hey, it's me again
I'm so in love with you again
Please can I see you every day

You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Til you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Til you heard the voices in your ear

I remember every word you said
(Word you said)
I remember voices in my head
(In my head)
I remember ever word you said
(Word you said)

I heard your voice-it
Your voice is-cool voices
Warm voices
Just what I needed, too
Words don't seem right
But its
Cool voices-warm voices
Your voice is
Just what I needed for
Love is the word-it's
Warm voices-your voice is
Cool voices
Just what I needed, too
I heard your voice-it was
Your voice is-cool voices
Warm voices

Just what I needed, too
Just what I needed, too
Just what I needed, too

Follow the footsteps
Or travel down your own road
Designing your fate
Hear what your heart says
Still you decide which way to go
Your life's an open gate

Le bon et le mal
These are the voices
We nous somme liberti
We make the choices

Echoes of laughter
Dancing in distant corridors
With the tears of hearts undone
Dreams we chase after
Give us the key to any door
We are what we become

Le bon et le mal
These are the voices
We nous somme liberti
We make the choices

Holding and reaching
We face the calm, we face the fear
As we learn to win and lose
Voices are speaking
Still we hear what we want to hear
Our life is ours to choose

Le bon et le mal
These are the voices
We nous somme liberti
We make the choices

Sweet voices calling wild, echoing around this child
Sweet Faith I'll be joining you, when my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day

Small secrets in the wind, blowing till the end begins
Oh my children stand by me till my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day

If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night, those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
The spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
The spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain

Nah....
Sweet voices calling wild , echoing around this child
Sweet Faith I'll be joining you , when my story's over

They spoke of people in the snow

La la ...

Once upon a time in another world
On a hill that overlooked the sea
There was once a garden of beauty and of grace
Lovely as a dream could ever be.

Then the roses bled and the lilies broke
On the day that death came to the garden
Hidden in the flowers, meant to break the heart
Flames that burst like blossoms in the garden.

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me,
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden

Name them all by heart, name them one by one
Countries where a child has lost tomorrow
Count the deadly flowers in the fields and woods
Count them like a rosary of sorrow.

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me,
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden.

Where the children played in the summer light
Running through the flowers on the hill
Laughter in their voices, hope within their hearts
Knowing they would live forever more.

I have seen a child barely five or six,
Counting bombs and tears, his childhood broken,
Give him back the garden, give him back his life
Give him back a world where love is spoken.

Let us join our voices far across the sea
Singing all together of the garden,
Let the roses bloom, let the lillies grow,
Let us live together for the children,
In our lovely garden.

And I'm hearing the whispers from my window
And I'm hearing something scratching on the inside
Could I feel the sea beckoning me
Oh, could it be can I see?

Voices
On the air
Voices
On the air

And I'm feeling like a moody situation
And I feel the waves laughing with contempt
Could I feel my senses leaving me?
Oh, could it be can I see?

Voices
On the air
Voices
On the air

Voices
On the air
Could it be can I see?
Voices

Between the open heart and the whisper goodbye
There's a perfect teardrop in your eye
Between the lover's moon and the trembling sky
There's a broken dream in your mind

And the voice is carrying the love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark

Between the careful touch and the breakaway kiss
There's a beauty you can't resist
Mmm, between the fall apart and the moment of bliss
There must be something more than this

And the voice is carrying the love you have lost
Love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars
Love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
In the dark
Hear the lonely voice
Hear the lonely voice

And the voice is carrying the love you have lost
Love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars
Love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark

Oh, yea, the voice is carrying the love you have lost
Love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars
Love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark. In the dark
Lonely voice. Lonely voice in the dark
Hear the lonely voice
Hear the lonely voice in the dark...

Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
Hey

I hear you calling, voices are here again
I hear you whisper, taking control of me
Watch the dancing shadows run away
All alone once again, afraid

All these faces, changing their shapes on me
I said laid it in my own world, will it ever be free?
Haunted figures around me, I want em' to stay
There always there to protect me, this is one thing you can't take away

Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
Yeah!

I hear you calling, voices are here again
I hear you whisper in my own mind, will it ever change?

I hear you calling

Bob drives taxis when the meter runs
Bobby hears the music when it's done
He hears the voices
He hears the voices

Wheels on rain, lightning from the storm
Bobby takes the gas
Pedal to the floor
The voices
He hears the voices

Coming from the traffic
Coming from the cube
Like the cry of babies
Passing through a tube
Voices run inside you

Jill breathes carbon trailing from the bus, it's like
Staring in the eyes of Lazarus
The voices
She hears the voices

Like a starving whisper no one ever heard
Like an epileptic hummingbird
The voices
She hears the voices





Who is the master? Who is the slave?

Treat me like a curse
And tell me I'm your savior
I'll never know the stranger
I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

First you say you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you
When you sold it to yourself

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

You are the only one that brings me peace
You are the only one where hope is seen
The mercy you've given is more than I deserve
So I lay it down so I can heed your word

Hear my voice, I raise to you
With honor and praise
All glory is due
I lay it all down at your feet
With lifted hands it's you we seek

You are the only one that bring me truth
You are the only one that makes me new
The grace you've given a gift for all to see
So this is why I give you everything

And to you I lift my voice
And to you I lift my hands
And to you I give my heart





I knew this would happen
And I don't want to be around
When it gets out.
I've closed the last picture

And painted the windows
Inside and out.
Give me your dreams
And I'll give you my time,

Together we'll cross the borderline.
Voices -
Cracking the night,
Voices -

That cut like a knife,
Voices -
Hear them singing...
From sparks to the fire,

From here to obsession they cover the end.
Twisting a match
And see the reflections of hunters of men.
Give me your dreams

And I'll give you my time,
Until we make it to the borderline.
Voices...

I hear your voice on the wind
And I hear you call out my name

"Listen, my child," you say to me
"I am the voice of your history
Be not afraid, come follow me
Answer my call, and I'll set you free"

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice, I will remain

I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone
The dance of the leaves when the autumn winds blow
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold winter long
I am the force that in springtime will grow

I am the voice of the past that will always be
Filled with my sorrow and blood in my fields
I am the voice of the future, bring me your peace
Bring me your peace, and my wounds, they will heal

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice

I am the voice of the past that will always be
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice of the future
I am the voice, I am the voice
I am the voice, I am the voice

I hear your voice on the wind
And I hear you call out my name

"Listen, my child," you say to me
"I am the voice of your history
Be not afraid, come follow me
Answer my call, and I'll set you free"

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice, I will remain

I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone
The dance of the leaves when the autumn winds blow
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold winter long
I am the force that in springtime will grow

I am the voice of the past that will always be
Filled with my sorrow and blood in my fields
I am the voice of the future, bring me your peace
Bring me your peace, and my wounds, they will heal

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice

I am the voice of the past that will always be
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice of the future
I am the voice, I am the voice
I am the voice, I am the voice

Who am I, is this me?
Am I one or thirteen?

I've gone cold, hard to deal
Used to stand where I kneel

Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?

I want more, than I need
I don't know what is real

Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?

Whispering of names, faces
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone
Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems

I've been told, dreaming's free
Think I'll go back to sleep

Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?

Calling out the names, faces
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone
Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems

It's almost a feeling you can touch in the air
You look all around you, but nobody's there
It's been a long time now since you've been aware
That somebody's watching you

He's gonna get you

Sooner or later when your big chances come
You'll look for the catches, but there'll be none
Remember before you grab the money and run
That someone is watching you

He's gonna get you.

Before you run and hide
He's gonna get you
You got no choice
'Cause you can't escape the voice

Jumping with shadows that come up from behind
You're scared of the darkness that's there in your mind
You're frightened to move because of what you might find
Someone is watching you

He's gonna get you.

Before you run and hide
He's gonna get you
You got no choice
'Cause you can't escape the voice

Voices in my head shouting their pain
While everyone around me is taking the blame
I hear their crying, I shed their tears
I've been rolling the dice for so many years

Voices, what do you want of me
Voices, which way do I turn
Voices, nightmares and mind games
Put down on paper for rock and roll puppets to laugh at

Jailers of passion on a one way street
Only mirrored reflections of people I meet
So turn on the noise hit yourself in the face
Well I've got the card to beat your ace

Voices, what do you want of me
Voices, which way do I turn
Voices, nightmares and mind games
Put down on paper for rock and roll puppets to laugh at

Temptations all around me
But I've got no choice
Emotions of an animal
On a tightened lead
Time is a circle on a telephone
I hear it ringing but I'm not at home
Problems are shallow so don't look back
Black and white checkmate
I won so how's that

Voices, what do you want of me
Voices, which way do I turn
Voices, nightmares and mind games
Put down on paper for rock and roll puppets to laugh at

I can see in your eyes
(You're) talking good but there's nobody home
And I'm breathing it in
But I'm sure that I've heard it before somewhere
I'm alive with the need
And your welcome to this exhibition ''cause I'm feeding on me
Now there's far to many opinions here

Voices like whispering friends
Voices are calling again
Voices no one can see
Voices are welcome to me
And I've been here once before

I don't know why I'm here
But I'm going to take what I can
I don't know who to fight
I can't run so I'm turning on you again
I think I need a friend
I need someone inside with the news
I think I need to sleep
Now and maybe forever

Won't you take me back to school?
I need to learn the golden rule.
Won't you lay it on the line?
I need to hear it just one more time.

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

Each and every heart it seems,
Is bounded by a world of dreams.
Each and every rising sun,
Is greeted by a lonely one.

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

Cause out on the ocean of life my love.
There a so many storms we must rise above.
Can you hear the spirit calling, as it's carried across the waves?
You're already falling it's calling you back to face the music.
And the song that is coming through.
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you.

My a promise take a vow.
And trust your feelings it easy now.
Understand The Voice within.
And feel a change already beginning.

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  Tonight?

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

And how many words have I got to say?
And how many times will it be this way?
With your arms around the future and your back up against the past.
You're already falling it's calling you on to face the music.
And the song that is coming through.
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you.

Each and every heart it seems,
Is bounded by a world of dreams.
Each and every rising sun,
Is greeted by, a lonely, lonely one.

Won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

I hear your voice on the wind
And I here you call out my name

'Listen my child', you say to me
'I am the voice of your history
Be not afraid, come follow me
Answer my call and I'll set you free'

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice, I will remain

I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone
The dance of the leaves when the autumn winds blow
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold winter long
I am the force that in springtime will grow

I am the voice of the past that will always be
Filled with my sorrow and blood in my fields
I am the voice of the future
Bring me your peace
Bring me your peace and my wounds, they will heal

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice

I am the voice of the past that will always be
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice of the future
I am the voice

I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice

The year number one has gone and turned
Into year of bomb
TV wars, twenty-four hours
But it happens

Fall advice, Fall advice, Fall advice

Shaking my bones down the M14
Passenger seat gripped tight
And seriously, I cannot sleep but I'm happy
I cannot eat, so what about it?
It happens, it happens, but it happens

Fall advice
The works down the drain
And interest never wanes, so what about it?

Some are born depressed about it
Fall advice, Fall advice, Fall advice, Fall advice

In lake districts
You're stepping around, it doesn't matter to me

It's magic, so what about it?

We are private detectives onward back from a musical pilgrimage
We work under the name of the Fall.
Who would suspect this?
It is too obvious.
Our office is secluded.
Those there to suspect
Would not see the wood for the trees
We were six like dice but we're back to five
Up here in the North there are no wage packet jobs for us
Thank Christ
While young married couples discuss the poverties
Of their self-built traps
And the junior clergy demand more cash
We spit in their plate and wait for the ice to melt

I must create a new regime
Or live by another man's
Before the moon falls
I must create a new scheme
And get out of others' hands
Before the moon falls

I could use some pure criminals
And get my hands on some royalties
Before the moon falls

A problem of this new scheme
Is answering obscene phone calls
Before the moon falls

Gotta stop drifting around
Kill this ugly duckling
We've got the power
And must not misuse it
'cause life is short and full of thought
I use the power

And will forever end this reign of terror
Before the moon falls
Before the tide subsides
Before the moon falls for the fifth time
Before The Fall swoons

Had a birthday yesterday, she cried.
Took off her glasses, let her hair down, and sighed.
She told them all at work, about her day.
How is it no one came? Woe, woe.

Took the invitations to her friends;
They were too busy, doing other things.
Told them all at work, about her day.
How is it no one came? Woe, woe.

She took the decorations from the wall.
It was the ladder loose, that made her fall.
She told them all at work, about her day.
How is it no one came? Woe, woe.

It's hard to live in the country
In the present state of things
Your body gets pulled right back
You get a terrible urge to drink

At 3AM
The stick people recede
The locals get up your nose
And leather soles stick on cobble stones

It's hard to live in the country
It has a delicate ring
Nymphet new romantics come over the hill
It gets a bit depressing

Paper local
Drunken scandal
Publish your address as well
Locals surround where you dwell
Old ladies confiscate your gate railings
For government campaigns

Its tough in home country
Councils hold the ring
D. Bowie lookalikes
Permeate car parks
Grab the churches while you can
Port-a-loos
Yellow cabins by Methodist doors
New Jersey car parks permeated by
D. Bowie sound-alikes

It's good to live in the country
You can get down to real thinking
Walk around look at geometric tracery
Hedgehogs skirt around your leathered soles
Fall down drunk on the road
It's good to live in the country

Look at yourself as a man
The valley rings with ice-cream vans
It's good to live in the country

Leather soles stick on precinct flagstones
Small up town Americas like your outskirt town

The villagers
Are surrounding the house
The locals have come for their due
It's hard to live in the country

The Leicester YOP, TEP, instructor
Emerged from corridor
His state-subsidized cannabis haze
Moved reptilian in its all-levelling routine
I said to him
It's about time you started thinking
About the black dog on your back
Said it's about time you started thinking
About the rerun which is your life
Moveable backdrop
The backdrop shifted and changed
The Manchester regiment of the Stuarts
Would not tread on your patch
Got nearly down to Derby you know
Was stopped by stinking Billy
And rode a racing horse which I had liberated
From a Tyneside lord
I said to the men
It's about time you started thinking
About the black dog on your back
It's about time you started thinking
About the void in your life
A military prison or worse
The backdrop shifted and changed
The [semite] man's home is full of sperm
And pulled down
His [masiso] was kicked around
As I did it I said to them
The backdrop shifted and changed
So did not even know what song it was
What it was
Who put the yellow pills in the Gordon's gin?
The backdrop shifted and changed
Until did not even know
When the lot come up
Bomb-hole in our schedule
Who put the yellow pills in the Gordon's gin?
The backdrop shifted and changed
Till the reptillian TEP instructor merged
With stinking Billy's morass of flesh
And the Yorkies drifted
1902 Metropole
The Yorkies [ripley yorks] shifted and drifted
I said to them
The backdrop shifted and changed
And this was The Fall
Goodnight

I'll go back to Manhattan,
As if nothing ever happened.
When I cross that bridge,
It'll be as if this don't exist.
Have a prince who is waiting,
And a kingdom downtown.
I'll go back to Manhattan,
As if nothing ever happened

Don't have to speak at all.
One look in your eyes,
And I won't have to fall,
Don't have to speak at all.

Brooklyn holds you
And holds my heart too.
What a fool I was to think
I could live in both worlds.

Don't have to speak at all.
One look in your eyes,
And I won't have to fall,
Don't have to speak at all.

I should go back to Manhattan,
It's just a train ride away.
I know nothing about leaving,
But I know I should do it today.

Have you ever got that downwards sinking feeling?
And just a touch of human hands make for healing?
He's watered down,
Amongst the crowd,
Always lost and searching for his own sound.

These concrete boots he wears,
Make it hard to reach the air.
These concrete boots he wears. (x3)

And now all the eyes are facing towards the south.
Just as narrow words try to escape his mouth.
The plastered faces,
Are painted white,
Just to keep the inside out of his sight.

These concrete boots he wears,
Make it hard to reach the air.
These concrete boots he wears. (x6)

He wears ...
He wears ...

Lay
Lay
Lay
Armageddon
This beautiful tree
Boo hoo
Give up living
Ample
Eye
They give in

On The Buses, up the stair
By the television
Pretend to learn

Where's the lay of the land
My son

Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son

The last Briton on the street
He's in a radio fuzz
He's dead and beat
No longer reflects our daft fate
We'll leave this city
Hit a quick coach, take the town in Surrey
There's no-one here but crooks and death
Kerb-crawlers,of the worst order

Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son

Eldritch house
With green moss
Sound of ordinary on the waves
Tiles drip from its roof
Home secretary has a weird look

Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son

The good Book of John
Surrounds the son
Sound of ordinary on the waves
Italic scribble on horizon
When the height of culture is a bad stew
Space bores, government disorder
Indian clerk, low-calorie drink
Where's the lay of the land
Where children circle in cycles
Giving jokes ad lib
By bearded writers
Who defected to
Higher realms
Advertising realms

Where's the lay of the land
My son
What's the lie of the land
My son

He was against the rich
He was against the poor
He was against all trepidation

He was against the rich
On the loose again
He was against the rich

There's a new fiend on the loose
On the back of the exhaust clip
Clipped on rich and poor alike
Come to roost again once more

Ol' Nick doesn't go from digs to digs no more
Hit him on the head with a 2 by 4
Nowadays he has a Georgian glazed porch

Used table leg to club son in law
New fiend in your home again
He said show me my quarters and glasses

There's a new fiend on the loose
Jolting in his tradition
It's a fear of the obtuse
He's got patents on the moaning

Imagine how it would be
To be at the top
Making cash money
Go and tour all
around the world
Tell stories about
all the young girls

Travel fast
Have a blast
Travel fast
Make it last
Girls rock the world!

You hear me
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Is there anybody there? Anybody there?
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about a girl who came to stay
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day

Girl girl girl
Girl girl girl
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She would turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why.

Girl girl girl
Oh girl girl girl
She's the kinda girl that puts you down when friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good she acts as if she's understood
Its cool
Girl girl girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Girl girl girl
Girl girl girl
Why don't you understand?
Why don't you understand woman, what I do for you?
How I'd break my back and sweat
Worthless little thing
Why am I wasting time on you?

Girl, girl can't ya hear me?
Oh where are ya,ya little devil?
Girl girl girl
Girl girl girl

You might be right around the corner
And you'll be the girl that I love
No one could take you
No other man can make you an offer
'Cause I'll be the one that you want (always)

I've been messing with so many girls
Who could give a damn about who I am
They don't like my boney body
They don't like my dirty hair
Or the stuff that I say
Or the stuff that I'm on

I'm gonna get you honey

I know you're somewhere
And nothing's ever gonna phase me
You'll look at me and know I'm the one
And you will love me
For all the reasons everyone hates me
And we can do whatever we want (always)

Mama, she really loved me
Even when I was bad
She'd hold my little hand
And kiss me on the cheek

And when I cried
She would hold me closely
And tell me "everything will be alright"
That woman loved me;
I need a woman who loves
Me, me me me me me (yeah)

I know you're out there
You might be right around the corner
And you'll be the girl that I love
And you'll be the girl that I love
And you'll be the girl that I love
And you'll be the girl that I love

Girls, all I really want is girls
And in the morning it's girls
'Cause in the evening it's girls

I like the way that they walk
And it's chilly to hear them talk
And I can always make them smile
From White Castle to the Nile

Back in the day
There was this girl around the way
She liked by home-piece M.C.A.
He said he would not give her play
I asked him, please?, he said, you may
Her pants were tight and that's O.K.
If she would dance, I would D.J.
We took a walk down to the bay

I hope she'll say,
Hey me and you should hit the hay
I asked her out, she said, no way
I should of probably guessed their gay
So I broke north with no delay
I heard she moved real far away
That was two years ago this May
I seen her just the other day
Jockin' Mike D. To my dismay

Girls, they are so lovely
Oh girls, girls, oh, please love me
Girls run around in your head

'Til you wish you had boys instead
Girls, they are such fragile stuff
That you just can't get enough

Oh girls, girls
They are impossible
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

Do I have girls?
Let me tell you about some girls
I have three girls
Rhonda, Tracee and Chudney

I have girls in my bathroom
Girls in my closet
Girls wearing my shoes

My lipstick, my perfume
Sleeping with my husband
What was that?

They say your life changes
When you have kids
Bring it way down, Gill
You know your life doesn't change, it ends

I've got a highschool crush on a California girl oh yeah
I've got a cool guitar and a bag of marijuana
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer I'm a big bad mean mother fucker

I've got an ice cream cone and i'm feeling fine tonight
When i get you back home i'm gonna make you fell alright
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer I'm a big bad mean mother fucker

I wear my short jean shorts on a sunny San Francisco day
I like to hang out by the water of the sunny San Francisco Bay
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer I'm a big bad mean mother fucker

Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do

Day dream near a stream where the winter bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued

She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again

Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one

It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to try it again

I've got nothing to do
And nobody to see
Nowhere to go
And nobody to be

I'm on a ghost train
In a ghost cloud
And I don't know how to get out
And get it to heaven

I had a beautiful girl
A musical dream (?)
She wanted it all
But she didn't want me

Now I'm a ghost man
In a ghost town
And I just wish I could get out
And get it to heaven

I like the bad boys
And their (?)
I like the bad bands
And their big sounds

I've got a ghost mouth
With a ghost frown
And I'm too scared to get out
And get it to heaven

I got to quit staying home
Gotta get outta here
It just hasn't been home
Since you haven't been here

I knew it when I heard it the first time
I knew it when I heard it the last time
Nothing compares to you

That's right

I've got nothing to do
And nobody to see
Nowhere to go
And nobody to be

I'm on a ghost train
In a ghost cloud
And I don't know how to get out
And get it to heaven

Yeah I just wish I could get out
And get it to heaven
But I'm too scared to get out
And get it to heaven

Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend
I wish I had a loving man in my life
I wish I had a father
Maybe then I would've turned out right
But now I'm just crazy, I'm totally mad
Yeah I'm just crazy, I'm fucked in the head
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you

Oh, I wish I had a suntan
Oh, I wish I had a pizza and a bottle of wine
Oh, I wish I had a beach house
Then we could make a big fire every night
Instead I'm just crazy, I'm totally mad
Yeah I'm just crazy, I'm fucked in the head
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you

C'mon c'mon c'mon Kayda

Where did it start?
We used to be friends
Now when I run into you
I pretend I don't see you, I know that you hate me

I've tried to be tough
I've tried to be mean
I don't want to be like this
And I hope that you listen, all I'm trying to say is

Reach out and touch me, I'm right here
And I don't want to fight anymore
I really wanna be your friend forever
Friend until the end of it all

I know I've made mistakes
But I'm asking you give me a break
I really wanna be your friend forever
Friends forever

You've been a bitch
I've been an ass
I don't want to point the finger
I just know I don't like it, I don't wanna do this

What can I do?
Is it too late?
I just want to say I'm sorry
And I hope you listen, all I'm trying to say is

Reach out and touch me, I'm right here
And I don't want to fight anymore
I really wanna be your friend forever
Friend until the end of it all

I know I've made mistakes
But I'm asking you give me a break
I really wanna be your friend forever
Friends forever

Laura, baby, I'm right here
And I don't wanna fight anymore
I really wanna be your friend forever
Friend until the end of it all

I know I've made mistakes
But I'm asking you to give me a break
I really wanna be your friend forever
Friends forever

Out of my crate
Dust off my grave
Get out a good pair of shoes
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Lay in the park
Smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Feelin' the breeze
Take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Grow out my hair
Go anywhere
Sleepin' until afternoon
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Feelin' the breeze
Take it with ease
Shake out the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Lay in the park
Smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

It isn't right to sit around and think about the awful things that get you down
You've gotta try to wear a smile no matter how hard it can be to do
I could make myself go crazy crying over times I've chased my broken dreams
But what is life without a dream and even I know dreams can still come true

Oh Lauren Marie
I might never get my arms around you but that doesn't mean that I won't try
Oh Lauren Marie
You might never want me but that doesn't mean that you won't get me high
Oh Lauren Marie
Oh Lauren Marie
Oh-oh Lauren Marie
Oh Lauren Marie
Oh Lauren Marie
Oh Lauren Marie
Oh-oh Lauren Marie
Oh Lauren Marie

I don't know where I'm going
But I'm headed somewhere
And it's not my time to die
Take a look up, Lauren
The clouds make way for the sunshine

No I'm never gonna fix up
And I might be crazy
But I really got it going on
Listen to me now I'm singing you a new song

Meet me in the morning light
We know it won't last forever
Wear it out while it feels right
We know that it's now or never
Meet me in the sky tonight
We could fly away together
Maybe if we try it right
We could make our love forever

 hear the strangest things echo through the walls
Moaning groaning eroneous zone bouncing like a ball
Crash bang boom bang bump-a-dee-bump - all night to meet the band
Oh no I feel the pain how much more can I stand
I pounded on the pipes
I call on the phone
There they go again
Bone to bone

Sex - Sex - Sex
Sex - Sex - Sex
Uh - Sex - Uh
Sex - Sex

I see them come I see them go
But somehow they look the same
Miniskirts and see-through shirts
A high heel crying shame
Check in and checkin' out
Well this ain't no sleaze hotel
Calling 'til the daylight comes
But check-out time is twelve

Dishes off the wall
The bed springs squeak
But the mating call
Makes a strong man weak

Sex - Sex - Sex
I want Apartment B
Sex - Sex - Sex
One floor on top of me
Uh - Sex - Uh
Oh baby up 'til now
Sex - Sex

My doors always open

My mailbox is waiting
My names in the book
Got ads in the paper
But nobody cares
Apartment A's lonely
The action's upstairs

Though the idea of confession, it is said to be
The union of and his bride, the Christian
It's all very puzzling

Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church and the church and the church

All the great mystic religions put strong emphasis
On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex, of sex
Christianity has been pretty modern about sex

Of sex, of sex, of sex, of sex
Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church, sex, sex

I think there is a union between the flesh and the spirit
Sex and the church, sex and the church
All religions' mother

Give me the freedom of spirit and the joys
Of the flesh and sex, sex, sex and the church
Give me the freedom of spirit and the joys
Of the flesh and sex, sex, sex and the church

Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church and the church and the church
Sex, sex, sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church, sex, sex, sex

Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church and the church and the church
Sex, sex, sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church, sex, sex

Sex, sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church, sex, sex

Sex in the morning,sex at night,sex in the afternoon's alright
Ain't a man on earth,that can stay alive
Without a, sex drive

Sex (x4)

I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MC's were on the bite
Bittin' my rhymes,stealin' my style
I rocked so hard,it wasn't true
I won the virgin girl,and her MAMA too

Sex (x4)

When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young ladies want a take me home
When the party's over,take me to their house
Throw me in the bed,know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say,"Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes
Your things,your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriends name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move I can't forget
I came,I came,I came again it felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars,my jewels,my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match ICE-T

Sex (x4)

Then she turn out the lights,throw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
And all at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best,the Ice-T chill
Start with her tongue upon the back of my leg

In their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
Deep,deep girls,I want to make you cry
I move it in and out,know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl,no joke,I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back,might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants

Do hast die Macht der Nacht
Deine Sehnsucht bringt dich zum Schrein
Denn heute Nacht hast do
Das Gefuhl unsterblich zu sein
Do siehst mich all und an
Deine Angst ist eliminiert
Und unser Fleisch verliert
Seine Form und assimiliert
Sex - Sex - Gib mir Sex
Do hast die Qual der Wahl
Doch do weisst do musst dich befrein
Zum ersten Mal hast do
Das Gefuhl am Leben zu sein
Do fasst mich an und all
Deine Angst ist eliminiert
Und unser Blut verlesst
Seine Bahn und kontaminiert
Sex - Sex - Gib mir sex

Woh hata rahe hain parda
Woh hata rahe hain parda
Sar-e-baam chupke chupke

Woh hata rahe hain parda
Sar-e-baam chupke chupke
Mein nazara kar raha hoon
Sare-e-shaam chupke chupke

Ye jhuki jhuki nigaahein
Ye hasein hasein isharay
Mujhe de rahe hain shayed
Woh payam chupke chupke

Na dikhaao chalte chalte
Yun kadam kadam pe shokhi
Koi katl ho raha hai
Koi katl ho raha hai
Sar-e-aam chupke chupke

Kabhi shokhian dikhana
Kabhi un ka muskurana
Yeh adaaein kar na dalein
Mera kaam chupke chupke

Ye jo hichkiyan musalsal
Mujhe aa rahi hain alam
Koi le raha hai shayed
Koi le raha hai shayed
Mera naam chupke chupke

Woh hata rahe hain parda

Well you know I don't get off on workin' day after day
I want to have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's goin' my way
And there's nothin' like a party when it's kickin' into gear

I'm gettin' ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm gettin' ready to cruise
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party!

I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
Yea there's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie

So come on
Get ready for the time of your life
'Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party!
So come on
Oh come on let's party down

Oh oh oh

Get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet some friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud

Get ready for a party tonight
'Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party!

Now a man doesn't live on bread alone
He's got to have some lovin' each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known




How vaguely we eschew complicity with You,
it's always run-arounds, excuses
and words we bind to nooses
just to sullenly let swing
the best of arbitrary things,
like, do we care about the poor?
Oh yes, but we support the king.

And we're starving for the slaughter.
A man gives up his daughter
and the walls that keep us safe aren't saving anyone.
Didn't You say
to risk everything?

And we're left dieting for more
and then we're burning on the tor
that flanks an emperor's affair.
We've hardly sacrificed before
so in manic heavenward stare
let the confession from our lungs
that as our bodies torch the air
to the fanfare and the drums,
amid drunken wild acclaim,
I have the urge to scream Your name.
without hesitance or shame
from my place among the burning.
And our bodies break, confirming
our inability to remain
without an object for our yearning.

Our inability, our inability.

"Oh God, accept our spirits
into Your holy presence"

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

I was at this club, this place called Roy's
I snuck in past my curfew trying hang with the big boys
There were hands swingin', people singin' and others on the wall
Disco lights blinkin' and people big and small

Security finally caught me, talkin' 'bout "Son you're kinda young"
I said, "Beat this Mr. Officer I'm just trying to have some fun"
Now on my way out, this girl said, "Whuddup shorty?"
I broke away from the officer and then said, "Girl, it's time to party"
You know

Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party

Next I went to a club to see what he said I was missin'
Snuck through the back door, it was like "Yeah, I can get with this"
A whole bunch of cuties surrounded by a bunch of moles
With dreadlocks, bell bottoms and a couple wearing Afros

Now I was Krossed Out, totally fly to the T
Getting all the girlies then I got caught by security
He grabbed me up and said, "Yo, I just kicked out your friend
And I don't want to see you and him around here ever again trying out"

Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party

Okay party people in the house
Okay party people in the house
Yeah, part

One night we both decided that we would go together
Totally Krossed Out, into more Krossed Out leather
Now I was lookin' fly from head to toe
And all we both could think about was reaching the back door

We were lookin' diggy diggy doe ready to rock
You know?
But when got to the back door
Oh, the back door shouldn't have be locked

Now Kris was getting mad, but I had other thoughts
Of ways of getting in,
When I was getting caught
So we could

Oh, party, ah, party

Now that the party's over
Now that the noise is through
Now that the room is empty
There's only me and you

I think that I might just fall in love with you, with you
There were so many people trying to talk to you
Telling you how they need you
Trying to get to you
I think that I might just fall in love with you with you

Party to my head (???)
Party (???)

Didn't seem to matter early on
But now that the people have gone
I think that I might just fall in love with you, with you

Ah, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play
Hey hey hey
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over

Tell me pretty baby
If you think you feel it too
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Gonna satisfy my soul

I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room

Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor.

I want him, and I need him,
And someday someway woo I'll meet him
He'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do

Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love

When he's near me, I'll kiss him,
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care
And I'll know it's gonna be alright 'cause we've got so much we share

Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love

(Johnny) no no he'll never do
(Bobby) no it isn't him too
They would never no they'd never never ever ever love
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love

Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh

I breathe everytime I'm near you
I see everytime I start
I feel I won the world in your heart

Some say it's a timeless matter
Sometimes it's an ageless art, baby
I feel I know this place in your heart, yeah

You storm me with your love
I never felt it so
You storm me with your love
And I ain't never letting go

You storm me with your love
Caught in the undertow

And I ain't never letting go

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you

There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
 I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you





Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you
Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you

Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you
Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you

Our love keeps getting broken, broken
With every girl you open, open
I keep wishing and a-hoping, hoping
You'll end it all, end it all

My bed keeps getting bigger, bigger
Every time you pull your trigger, trigger
Their love, it always lingers, lingers
End it all

Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you
Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you

Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you
Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you

Drink, drink
Drink

You're lucky you're good-looking, looking
'Cause with all the hearts you've tooken, tooken
Our love it should be shooken, shooken
I can't stop, I can't stop

I always wanna leave you, leave you
Until I finally see you, see you
And then I kinda need you, need you
I can't stop

Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you
Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you

Wish I had a drink
So I don't have to think about you
Wish I had a drink

So I don't have to think about you

Whoa, whoa
I can't wait to let you go
Whoa, whoa
I can't wait to tell you no
Whoa, whoa
I can't wait to let you go
Whoa, whoa

Wish I had a drink

(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)
A rose a carnation the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet
But only the orchid was worthy of you so I threw all the others away
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals and after a day or two
The flower still blooms but it scents not the orchids it carries the savor of you
(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)

So if you're gonna drink to me drink with your eyes and I'll never cry for wine
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine
Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul and honey from a sugar tree
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe
Honey come here and drink to me drink to me drink to me
(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)

Lovingly, longingly soon into mine!

Tonight with joy my own lips meet!

Oy you give me some beer!

Piracy's a crime and crime doesn't pay
And we go home poor at the end of the day
But I'd rather live my life in rags
Than be taped to a desk with a wife as a hag
We live each day like there's nothing to lose
But a man has needs and the need is booze
They say all the best things in life are free
So give all your beer and your rum to me!

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at a point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer
We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at a point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

Drink, drink, drink, drink,
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
Drink, drink, drink

We've sailed all the seas for wenches and mead
And told great tales of the huntmasters' deeds
The quest for a drum of the famous ol' spiced
Has shown us the wrath of leviathans might
We went back through time to get more rum
Though we end up shipwrecked having no fun
But heavy metal pirates we must be
So give all your beer and your rum to me!

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at a point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer
We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at a point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at a point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer
We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at a point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

Drink, drink, drink, drink,

This is for my ladies,
Sexy like champagne Glass,
You what I'm talking about,
A reflection of a Pena Colada,
Listen up

I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars,
Well I treat bitches like drinks,
When I step in the club and by out tha bar,
So let me quench my thirst wit you and a friend
Instead of the juice and gin,
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in,
Glass full of ass for a true mutha fucka,
Wit that that turquoise Coogi on,
You remind me of a blue motherfucker,
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada,
But I think Gina was hotta,
Cause her skin tone was like a pina colada,
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies,
So I ordered them a mi tia and hot saki,
Then I got cocky,
And asked them do they come to this club a lot,
Well ya got a brotha hot,
Hop in my bubble drop,
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita one wit the karma of margarita,
The other one like two shots of tequila,
And they all fine I really don't know what to think,
As I get bubble and choose and try to figure out,

[Chorus]
What's my favorite drink,
Girl can I sip on you,
Sip on
Sip on
Sip on
Sip on
What's my favorite drink,

Know not to bring no Neapolitan ass,
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neapolitan masta,
No telling what these thick bitches would do,
Reminiscent of a big old picture of Bo,
But hit cha like a slow screw,
Dip in a strip a club in LA wit a bankroll,
Where the weather ain't cold,
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll,
I met two dancers named Moet and crystal,
I was checkin' they style,
We had a session It was wet it was wild,
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remy Red,
Wit skinny legs,
Both of them game to give me head,
Wit a little bit absolute vodka fo they homie Tasha,
Tell her to come closa,
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa,
If I was mayor I would campaign ass,
Politician wit women swimming around the champagne glass,
Drunk so much I might earl in the sink,
And if you ask me why,
I couldn't figure out

[Chorus]

If you would suck my soul,
I shall lick your funky emotions,
Look at that big old donkey you toting,
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop cup,
And have a toast wit King Boo,
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck,
I holla Church cause its pimps in tha party,
Let me sip on ya body,
Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi,
Or a long Island havin' sex on da beach,
Or in tha Llac sunroof let back wit a tech on tha seat,
Got a red bone I call her strawberry Daiquiri,
Bring her back fo may,
Carry packs fo may,
Had her suck off my facultay,
Got a little mamma name Mimi,
Who remind me of martini and Asti spamanti,
How she move to my CD,
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat,
She help me shake up dope,
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke,
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think,
As I get bubbly and choose,
And try to figure out

[Chorus]

Hennessey mixed wit some of that Alize,
Gimme a shot of that remy,
And a whole lot of tanqueray,
Keep it comin' wit that cognac,
Pop tha moet lets sip on that,
Naw playa put ya money back,
Cause these drinks on me,
Give me a bottle of that belve,
Long island ice tea,
Hook me up a apple martini,
All these drinks on me,
I want to have a sex on the beach,
How about a gin and juice for me,
So put away ya money G,
All these drinks on me,

All these drinks on me,

I left you a note on the table; I hope it finds you well,
I hope you don't hurt like you did, 'cause I'd just blame myself,
And I know its for me that I'm out on these streets,
Bleeding nightly for these people I meet,
But it's you who I long for when I cannot sleep,
It's enough, it could drive me to drink.

And I...I am almost nowhere, and I'm getting there fast,
You...you're the hope in my cold stare,
You're the drink in my hand.

When I picked up, you broke into tears,
You said you weren't busy enough,
I still don't know why you need me and my broken down love,
With each second that ticks, your voice rings in my ears and the memories flood back from all of our years,
And I tell you, "It's okay, there's nothing to fear," and I secretly hope I am right.

And I...I am almost nowhere, I'm getting there fast,
And you...you're the hope in my cold stare,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand.

I left you last week, and you told me, "Go on and follow your dreams,"
I think about that lately; still I don't know what it means,
'Cause you're what I dream of when I wake alone, as I drift away, as we talk on the phone ,
You're what I want, and that's all I know,
And I still just can't wait to get home.

And I...I am almost nowhere, and I'm getting there fast,
And you...you're the hope in my cold stare,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand,
You're the drink in my hand.

Weatherman said, "it's 105"
Is it global warming, I'm trying to decide
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink
Is there life on Mars, the question begs
What came first, the chicken or the egg?
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink

It'll make you stop
And go inside of your favorite bar
And sit a while on a tall barstool
And think and think and think
No, you don't need a big excuse
To pop a top and cut it loose
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink

Well, I recall a buddy of mine
He dropped dead when he was only forty-nine
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink
He left all his money behind
His best friend married his widow wife
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink

It'll make you stop
And go inside of your favorite bar
And sit a while on a tall barstool
And think and think and think
No, you don't need a big excuse
To pop a top and cut it loose
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink

You know the common man can't get a break
Wall Street cheats and guess who pays?
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink
You're headed home, the work day is done
Neon sign flashing two-for-one
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink

Oh, it'll make you stop
And go inside of your favorite bar
And sit a while on a tall barstool
And think and think and think
No, you don't need a big excuse
To pop a top and cut it loose
Little stuff like that will make you stop and drink

Yeah, little stuff like that will make you stop and drink
Ooh, yeah man, put it over here boys, I need a drink

Talk on the phone, stare at the screen
Doin' the job, livin' the dream
Gettin' paid, yeah right
Thinkin' about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
Instead of going home tonight

Been a long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Happy hour's like a holiday
Hanging with you's like getting away
Let's conversate for a little while
Well, keep me company, catch me up
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time 9 to 5, I'd rather see you smile

Long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Been a long day and the boss don't get it
Don't you wanna take the edge off with some 7 and 7?
Just crushin' on a friend, tell me what's it gonna hurt
Sippin' and tippin' some drinks after work?

Long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Long day, no break
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?
Sippin' and tippin' some drinks after work

A house full of thieves and liars

Spend your lazy, endless crazy days, inside my head,
You're so selfish, you're not the only one who thinks he's dead
I'm paid to smile, now I'm on trial for what you think I said
'Cause I never said that everything would be ok
And I never said that we would live to see another day

Motivate me, I want to get myself out of this bed
Captivate me, I want good thoughts inside of my head
When I fall down would you come around and pick me right up off the ground

I'm un-artistic, I'm un-realistic
You say I'm selfish and absurd
You try to change me, you try to save me
You say I'm gonna learn, I'm so blind
I'm out of time, You're so unkind sometimes
I never lied, I never lied, I never lied

'Cause everything it'll be OK
You know we're gonna live to see another day
Yeah, yeah
Motivate me yeah
Motivate me yeah

Yeah, this song is dedicated to every kid who ever got picked last in gym class (yeah, 1999)
This is for you
To every kid who never had a date to no school dance (2000 eternal)
This is for you
To everyone who's ever been called a freak (come with meeeee)
Here we, here we go
What? (y'all know what I'm talking about, y'all know what I'm saying)

Like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
And the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five)
Like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (we still suck)
Like the time that girl broke up with me cause I wasn't cool enough
Trick!

Things...
The little things they always hang around
The little things they try to break me down
The little things they just won't go away
The little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me know
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now

What? Come on. Ungh.
Here we go

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you guys later)
We checked his room, his things were gone
We didn't see him no more
Dick!

Things...
The little things they always hang around
The little things they try to break me down
The little things they just won't go away
The little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me know
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now
It always seems those little things they take the biggest part of me...

And I know that those little things they make the biggest part of me break down
I'm breaking down
Break down
Gotta maintain

Listen up 'cause there ain't nothin' funny,
I want to hot girl and a little bit of money,
I want to little house where my band can live,
'Cause we're tired of movin' every other weekend
I want to go to parties where they got no guns,
I want to rock with my band, I want to have a little fun
Where thugs and punks and any other type,
Can sing this song and sing it all night,

Everything's gonna be alright now,
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now,
Let's do this one more time,
Everything'll be alright,
Everything will be alright, alright

All I want to do is kick the welfare,
All I want to do is get my share
All I want to do is kick the welfare,
All I want to do is get my share
And I don't want to run for the president,
I just want an honest way to pay my rent
And I'm tired of the man always shuttin' us down,
Tired of my old man 'cause he's never around
And I'm tired of eating off of other people's plates,
And I don't look important, so they're tellin' me to wait
Police records said they wouldn't exist,
I want to know the meaning of a Christmas list
Said all I want to do is kick the welfare,
All I want to do is get my share,
All I want to do is make somethin' from nothin',
It's G.C. baby and we're workin' with somethin',

Everything's gonna be alright now,
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now,
Let's do this one more time,
Everything'll be alright,
Everything will be alright, alright

We'll be self-made millionaires,
These lives we'll lead without a care, oh yeah,
And we'll see what we'll be
Everything's gonna be alright now,
Everybody say it one more time,
Everything will be alright, alright,
We'll see you when we get there,
We'll see you when we get there,
On the video, Or the radio,
In the magazines, On the movie screens

Walking on the streets of D.C.
On the east coast where I live, You say what's the problem
What's with this angry kid
You don't like the way I walk, Or the way I talk,
Or the way I swing my hands,
You don't like the words I speak, or the thoughts I think
And I know you'll never understand

You know
On the east coast, we ride until we die
You know,
Well there's a place inside my mind,
Yeah a place you'll never find,
There's a place inside my mind, walk this way
You know

And wouldn't it be perfect if I could sit with you?
And we would change a thing or two, we would change a thing or two,
We would change the way you think, we would change the way I think,
We can't change the way they think so we're not changin' anything

You know
On the east coast, we ride until we die
You know,
Well there's a place inside my mind,
Yeah a place you'll never find,
There's a place inside my mind, we'll leave today
You know

'Cause on the east coast we ride, until the day we die
Well there's a place inside my mind,
Yeah a place you'll never find,
There's a place inside my mind walk this way
Well there's a place inside my mind,
Yeah a place you'll never find,
There's a place inside my mind we'll leave today
You know

Don't care about a thing today
I used to but I'm fed up
And I can hear the words you say
I wish that you would shut up

I've got responsibility
That is my liability
A menace to society
At least that's what they say to me

But tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

People always tell me not to waste my time
To get a real job and get back in line
You can say I'll never be a millionaire
Tell me this guitar won't get me anywhere

I've got responsibility
That is my liability
I'm questioning authority
They say there's not a chance for me

But tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

Your future's no future
Your future's no future
Your future's no future
I control my future

But tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

Tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving tonight

And we've been here for so many years,
Still it seems as if you're not there (are you there)
Every time I talk, you turn away (do you care),
Isn't Dad an obligation to care

[Chorus]
And we've been here for so many years,
So many years still it seems,
So complicated, overrated, complicated,
This feeling is low

Well I came in the door, I said it before,
I never let the stress get me down no more
Giving thanks to the Lord, and I pray every day,
Giving shots to my peeps and this is what we said,

[Chorus]

You left us one little room with a black and white TV,
One eviction notice, and a bill for therapy,
You're living all alone you're like a dog without a bone,
You're living all alone 'cause you left us all at home,
Well you had a second chance but you threw it all away,
A fourth and fifth and sixth but that was yesterday,
Now you're sitting at a bar just a drowning in your tears,
Lonely in your corner while everybody cheers,

[Chorus]

Enemy, all over my body
She's wrapped up
She's wrapped up in alcohol
She's wrapped up
She's wrapped up in caffeine
She's my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy

I woke up, she was painting the lattice
She can't see through her mother's magnets
She can't see, she breathes electricity
She's my enemy
She is my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy
She's my enemy, enemy

I woke up, she was painting the lattice
She can't see through her mother's magnets
She can't see, she breathes electricity
She's my enemy
She is my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy
She's my enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy
She's my enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy
She's my enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy
She's my enemy, yeah

Every time the blood runs to my head I hear the ring
Something to remind me I'm not dead or caught in between
I listen to the voice and what it says its never sweet
Something I was born into I guess livin' in me

No prize nothing I pay will make it all rised
Nothin' I see will make it lose sight
Nothin' I take will make me sleep at night ,sleep at night
When I look at them and I feel I guess I got to be running running running runinn
I will never sake this feeling till I feel nothing nothing nothin

I'm the enemy enemy enemy inside of me enemy enemy enemy
I'm the enemy enemy enemy inside of me enemy enemy enemy

Everytime I take another breath I feel
Everyone around is seem so numb I feel everything

No prize nothing I pay will make it all rised
Nothin' I see will make it lose sight
Nothin' I take will make me sleep at night ,sleep at night
When I look at them and I feel I guess I got to be runnin' runnin' runnin'
I will never sake this feeling till I feel nothing nothing nothin

I'm the enemy enemy enemy inside of me enemy enemy enemy
I'm the enemy enemy enemy inside of me enemy enemy enemy

Taking my time to untangle the wires and staring to my sanity
Plopping the hammer and pulling the trigger I know now the bullet is me

I'm the enemy inside of me,
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me enemy, enemy, enemy
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me enemy, enemy, enemy

Every January 16th it's "The Dreamer The Dreamer."
And all of you say "I have a dream The Dreamer."
And what did he dream?
It stuck him right there.
And little black boys and little white girls
Will one day hold hands together.
Shit.
Is that where it's at?
Is that where it's at now?
Them little blacks hands are yours.
You can't hold the black brothers' hands?
But you gonna grow old holdin' crackers' hands
Before you hold each other's hands?
You gonna walk with your enemy
Before you learn to walk with one another?
How sick can you be?
(Enemy)

Where you gonna go when the brothers want to bust a shot
Where you gonna go when I want to kill bloodclot
Supercat said that the ghetto red hot
Bust a gloc, bust a gloc, devils get shot
Nappy-headed, no-dreded look where ya read it
Buck the devil, buck the devil, look who said it
Listen what I say after 1995 not one death will be alive
God will survive, him protect the civilized
Who really cares if the enemy lives or dies?
Not me, not me
Me never eat from the tree with the apple
I'd rather have a Snapple
Do you know where you're going to
Do you know where you're runnin' from
Scared of the sun, I live in the sun
You shrivel up like a raisin
And burn like the blunt that I'm blazin'
Ku Klux Klan scared of my nutty beats
Cause them nutty beats equal bloody sheets
Out number you somethin' like 15 to 3
See, don't love your enemy

[Chorus]
Enemies, enemy runnin' from the G
Enemies, enemy, you're my enemy
Enemies, enemy, when will I see?
Enemies, enemy R.I.P.

Where you gonna run when God want to do ya?
J. Edgar Hoover, I wish I woulda knew ya
With the boom ping ping is the ring from the fire
Me not afraid, cause me know Elijah
Goin to the East but straight from the Westside
Swing down sweet chariot and let me ride
Through the fire, through the fire that will please us
I know that Farrakhan is your baby Jesus
Devil don't you know I'm a soldier?
In God's name and the baby claim I'm gonna hold ya
Like Folger's Crystals feds
I'ma pick your ass like Juan Valdez
You don't care if me die from the cracker
You don't care if me have a heart attacker
You don't care if me get car jacker
You don't care cause you're nothing but a cracker
Now it's Judgment Day, and Allah'll never play
"freedom got an AK," them Guerrilla say
Bobby Seale said, "please make it rough, bro"
When God give the word, me herd like the buffalo
Through your neighborhood, watch me blast
Tribe of Shabazz, get in that ass
You shoulda took heed of my word and became a friend of me
Now you're just a enemy

[Chorus]

Now I change my style up, my style up,bodies pile up
Just to trouble you, throwin' out the W
Sent me a subpoena
Cause I kill more crackers then Bosnia, Herze - govina
Each and every day out a siz-tre Chevrolet
With the heavy A to the motherfuckin' K
Now you treat me like a germ
Cause your scared of the su - per sperm
Please don't bust til you see, the whites of his eyes
The whites of his skin, the whites of his lies
Nappy head nigga with the bone in his nose
Ya scared I'ma put this bone in your hoes
But I don't want to, I've been to cona
From the cavebitch with the nasty persona
Hit me with the big black billy club
Cause you white and your hoe than a silly nub
Three men in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
And it's really scary, now they're in the military
Sodom and Gomorrah, devil read your Torah,
Bible, Holy Qur'an
Once again it's on, got the hollow point teflon
And the brother Ron 2X, so who's next?
(devil)
With Dub see, Brother G
Crazy Toons is a crazy coon ready for the enemy
High off the Hennessey
Hundred ten degree, no it's not Tennessee
West L.A., what the hell can I say?
Niggas want to play, each and every day
Pass me the pill, a nigga shoot the J
Rougher than the roughest rough motherfucker, had enough motherfucker?
Handcuff this motherfuckerwith the duct tape, tie it to the bumper
Grab his bitch, dump her, cause nobody want to hump her
They call me Thumper cause I thump til it hurt
Knock your dick in the dirt, puttin' in work
Master Farad Muhammad comin' like a comet
When they see em, they all start to vomit
1995, Elijah is alive
Lewis Farrakhan, NOI
Bloods and Crips and little ol' me
And we all gettin' ready for the enemy

Hey Mister, backstabbin' son of a bitch
You're livin' in a world that'll soon be dyin'
And I know everybody knows you try to be like me
But even at your best as a man, you couldn't equal half of me

I am realizing that everybody's lost their simple ways
And now that it's here, I see it all so clearly
I've come face to face with the enemy, the enemy

You, you're another shit talkin' punk to me
You're a living inspiration for what I never wanna be
And I see you've been blinded by what you believe
And now back up and sit down, shut up and act like you need to be

I am realizing that everybody's lost their simple ways
And now that it's here, I see it all so clearly
I've come face to face with the enemy, the enemy

Come to me, come to me
The enemy come to me, come to me

So predicting you're the reason why I lie
Simple decision took me too much time to fly
Oh, checkmate

I am realizing that everybody's lost their simple ways
And now that it's here, I see it all so clearly
I've come face to face with the enemy, the enemy

Step up to me, Step up to me
You want to be a big time player, it's not to be
Look at all the snide ass, actin' like a wise ass
I'll fuck up your face and you'll never look back

So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
And no one at all is around
So tell me how does it feel to be the enemy?

Step up to me, Step up to me

Cut your fucking hair now, scared of all the stare downs
You want to be like me cause it's real
So you steal on your way to fame
Never gonna be, never gonna see
Your name in lights, you can always dream what 'cha could've been
Clean up my shit, you look like a dick
Step to unemployment, step

So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
And no one at all is around
So tell me how does it feel to be the enemy?

Staring at the picture of someone I know I love
We had to part, now you're gone
Cannot sleep at night I toss and turn for the world to see
We're killing time with myself

And you are always there to remind me
Your face if you're never around me
You are always there to remind me
You make me feel loved
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy

Wishing for the days that we first met and we moved out
To places where we could die
To places where we could die

And you are always there to remind me
Your face if you're never around me
You are always there to remind me
You make me feel loved
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy

I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy

The words you used were mine, used a thousand times
Doesn't make them what I've bled
I hated you, I loathed you
Though felt, I never let the words begin to spill

Make me sick 'till I can't breathe
Never want to be your enemy
Silence me, so I can't be,
Never want to be your enemy
I walk the

High road away from you
God knows what I've been through
This is the life I have, this is the life I choose
I walked away, the high road away from you
Walk away, walk away, you made an enemy

I never, I never wanted, I never wanted to poison or burn through
Labeled malcontent, by bastards of decent,
Excuse this place I stand, words are to elude you

Make me sick 'till I can't breathe
Never want to be your enemy
Silence me, so I can't be,
Never want to be your enemy
I walk the

High road away from you
God knows what I've been through
This is the life I have, this is the life I choose
I walked away, the high road away from you
Walk away, walk away, you made an enemy

Deep inside realize never want to be your enemy
Change me, rearrange me, make me your enemy (Yeah)
Deep inside realize never want to be your enemy (Walk away from)
Change me, rearrange me, make me your enemy (Enemy, yeah)
Deep inside realize never want to be your enemy (Walk away from)
Change me, rearrange me, make me your enemy, your enemy
I walk the

High road away from you
God knows what I've been through
This is the life I have, this is the life I choose
I walked away, the high road away from you
Walk away, walk away, you made an enemy

After we spoke I had a dream that I broke
The teeth from a mouth of a snake
That I choked on the teeth
They were mine all along

I picked up the pieces when I woke
Put them in a boat made of things that I don't want to see
I blew on the sail
Watched it drift out to sea
The further it drifted the closer it came to me
I can't explain

So I took it apart in a billion boxes
There was only one thing
You might think I'm your enemy
But that don't make you mine
And all I have now is above thee
I wish that you'd stop trying
Oh, please stop lying
Stop la la la la la la la
La la la la la
The hatred in the box then I locked
The strongest one I knew
I buried it all, grew a tree without thorns
Sat beneath the shade
You might think I'm your enemy
But that don't make you mine
And all I have now is above thee
I wish that you'd stop trying
Oh please stop lying
Please stop la la la la la la
La la la la la

Well, it comes as no surprise,
Don't you realize you can't back up deceit with more sad alibis
Because you never are to blame, drivin' you insane cause
When your words are gone the damage still remains
You don't wanna believe that you're human just like me
(By blaming me you gain control)
I'm not the enemy
(You want a scapegoat for your crimes)
You're just like me, me, me
And I'm not the enemy
You're just like me

It seems impossible to me,
A tragic comedy that I'm the villain in your twisted fantasy
But to me it's not a game drivin' me insane,
We're all just victims in your sinister charade

You don't wanna believe that you're human just like me

And I'm not the enemy

Isn't it weird?
Isn't it strange?
Even though we're just two strangers on this runaway train
We're both trying to find a place in the sun
We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone?
Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes?

Weird, oh ho

Isn't it hard
Standing in the rain?
You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain
No one can hear, but you're screaming so loud
You feel like you're all alone in a faceless crowd
Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes?

Sitting on the side
Waiting for a sign
Hoping that my luck will change
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same
When you live in a cookie-cutter world, being different is a sin
So you don't stand out
But you don't fit in

Weird, whoa, oh
Sitting on the side
Waiting for a sign
Hoping that my luck will change
Oh ho
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same
When you live in a cookie cutter world if you're different you can't win
So you don't stand out and you don't fit in
Oh, isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird?
Strange, how we all get a little bit
Strange, how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes
Oh, just a little bit weird sometimes

I like the way you never sleep
And the promises you never keep
I like the way you say hello
And make it sound like time to go

I like the scar above your lip
The way you let your feelings slip
But they are never what you feel
Oh so fake but completely real

Don't you think it's weird?
Weirder than weird
That's what you are, that's what you want to be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Don't you think it's weird?

You break the rules that don't apply
And let the good things pass you by
Standing here without a plan
That's why you're such a happy man

Don't you think it's weird?
Weirder than weird
That's what you are, that's what you want to be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Don't you think it's, 1, 2

I want to make some changes
I want my money back
I want to start up again, yeah
I want to talk to strangers
I want to be with you but I just don't know where or when

That's what you are, that's what you want to be
What I like about you is what you like about me

Don't you think it's weird?
Weirder than weird
That's what you are, that's what you want to be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Don't you think it's weird?

The sun is down when I'm around
In this town I wear the frown
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird

I feel the strain, I use a cane
To walk the lane of wonderful pain
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird

I live in fear, I have no beer
I sleep in jails and everything fails
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird

I have no cash, I have no stash
I keep the trash and clean it for you
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird

I've been thinking all day, but I've got nothing good to say
There's a war on my mind, let me leave it all behind
Things we'll never share are hangin' heavy in the air
With all the weird on the way, let me have a perfect day
But paranoia's contagious; I'm coming down with it, too
You better throw your trust on the fire first
Before I do
It's a world of demand, it doesn't stop to understand
And it's of world in demands, doesn't stop to understand you
If you're waitin' on me to tie you up, set you free
You'll be waitin' all day, all I want to do is play
But paranoia's contagious; I'm coming down with it, too
Better throw your trust on the fire first
Before I do
Before I do
And if we want to be happy, it's all here to be used
But settin' the world on fire burns, I thought you knew
You thought I knew
We never knew
We never ever knew
We never knew
We never knew

In my arms and my legs and my hips and my shoulders
And my neck to my feet in my brain lets
Must I shout to be heard
Heard by you and your kind
In your offices all around listen up for a
It's a weird feeling friend
I can't understand it at all
Speak of me when I'm dead with your hand on my face
All those memories that besot you where's a life looser?

It's a weird fucking feeling friend
And I don't wish it upon no one
In the morning when we wake
We go down to the place
When we get there we kick a ball
We kick a ball in the car
Said it'd make me feel alright
Said it'd make me feel alright. Feel alright
Put a little smile on my face

You weird

Weird nightmare
You haunt my every dream
Weird nightmare
Tell me what`s your scheme?
Can it be that you`re a part
Of a lonely broken heart?

Weird nightmare
Why must you torment me?
Weird nightmare
Pain and misery
In a heart that`s loved and lost
Take away the grief you`ve caused

Can`t sleep at night
Twist, turn in fright
With the fear that I`ll live it all again
In my dreams
You`re there to haunt me
When you say she doesn't want me
I've been hurt
Do you know what that means?

Weird nightmare
Take away this dream you`ve born
Weird nightmare
Mend a heart that`s torn
That has paid the price of love
A thousand fold
Bring me a love
With a heart of gold

Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you
'Cause you're part of this place
But if I die, don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey
Sweet baby

Hey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around

It's a weird world, don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey, sweet baby

Well, I never got my license to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yeah, some dumb, weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yes, some dumb weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head out on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Some weird sin
Some weird sin

Mama had such high hopes for me
Love I don't know where'd those hopes go
Mama's gonna buy me a DVD
When the saints march into the W Hotel
Mama's gonna buy me new hair gel
Love is gonna tell me love don't last
Mama's gonna tell me I ain't high class
Love is gonna be a long lost biological father
Lover's gonna give me worst day of my life
Mamas gonna tell me the world I thought
Was the world is not the world
Love is gonna make me a hungry man

Here I am again,
gonna cure the common cold,
end world hunger and
get my movie sold (and uh)...
Gonna teach the world to sing,
give 'em all a hand,
solve their problems and
gonna take a stand

Look around,
come back down
Try to rearrange it once again
And you hold your own,
nails to the stone
You've got it and you don't know what it is

Would you gain?
Time after time it's the same old wrong
Change and you change it's the same old song

I'm bothered by the fact
you cannot take it back
It goes on record and
multiplies, at that (and uh)...
I gotta break it down
to its smallest part
Put it back together and
call it art

Look around,
come back down
Try to rearrange it once again
And you hold your own,
nails to the stone
You've got it and you don't know what it is

Would you gain?
Time after time, it's the same old wrong
You change and you change, it's the same old song

You change and you change...
You change and you change...

Would you gain?

A selfish act of decency
I supplied you on the phone
Faded past, lost memories
You think it best if I go

I kept you around for when I fall down
I'll need you there for me
Unto you, I'll give my heart
But then you take it all away from me

Leave it alone, while I'm pushing away
I don't feel you close to me
Taking away what's left in me
Now I need to find a way

I don't want to lose you, not before I change
I don't need to use you, nothing more I'd gain

I think I'm scared of being here
Take it all away

Take it all away

Take it all away

I don't want to lose you, not before I change
I don't need to use you, nothing more I'd gain
I don't want to lose you, not before I change

Hey brother man, where is your plan for every man
Yes if I, yes if I, if I de Wolde Wolde Wolde
If I should have everything that the world possess
Would it be that my life will forever be in happiness

Material gain it's nothing to gain
If you don't have yourself, you've got nothing to gain
Material gain can bring many fame
It can never make you live again
It can never make you live again

Everyone will never be what they really want to be
'Til we got one love, one heart, one love, one heart
One aim one destiny
It's the universal woe, universal bounder
Between man and nation all that I see is frustration
Hunger and poverty no love for you, no love for me

Material gain it's nothing to gain
If you don't have yourself, you've got nothing to gain
'Til you are ready
Material gain can bring many fame
Where is your gain if you don't have yourself

Better take it easy
It's a daily diet t'ing
The transformation of all human, and of a natural
Quality quality
Material gain it's nothing to gain

We started?
I've got so much, so much shit to do, don't even know where to start
Be here forever
I think that's the plan, ya know?
Start here, end up there
Soon as you think something's goin' on you start back over
It's never gonna be the same
I ain't complainin' though
I really wouldn't have it, any other way
Nigga!

Every day you wake up your destiny depends on what you do
Sometimes I roll up when I'm stressed out and sometimes I roll two
Here people sayin' shit about the way I am but I know that ain't true
At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too
I made some phone calls and checked emails cause I'm always grindin'
Ain't no rush, I do things slow cause it's all about timing
Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it
I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted
I ain't there, but if I can I'mma try to be perfect
And for those that's ridin' with me, I'mma try to make it worth it
I drink too much, I pray for weed, cause it's better for the stress
I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy my schedule's a mess

Man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain, no pain)
Man I work hard

Just left another one
Just wrote another one
Just got another check
'Bout to thumb through another one
Fallin' asleep on the plane, no pet the flight come with one
Young nigga holdin' it down, don't care if it make you uncomfortable
Hardly spend nights at the crib, homie that's just how I live
Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid
I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is
You niggas ain't killin shit, no you niggas ain't killin shit
What they doin'? They say, "Nothin'!"
Where they goin'? They say, "Nothin'!"
Call my phone, it ain't nothin'
I smoke a lot but don't judge me
Probably wake up earlier than all of you niggas
Mafuckas always hated the squad,
But all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin' and I get paid

Man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain, no pain)
Man I work hard

Get dressed at seven
Be up by nine
I'm up all night
These friends of mine

The needle drops
The stereo gives
Its never too late to learn how to live

We've been waiting around for so long
Just to hear some decent songs
Well this is all such an urgency

We remember those nights in radio five
When the dance balls kicked us all alive
And I fell in love with the club forty-five
Hey hey hey I remember dreaming as I fell
Hey hey hey but there are somethings that mere songs can never tell

The kids in the club are hot enough
The kids in the club are strong enough
The kids at the club are falling in love

The kids at the club are hot enough
The kids at the club are what gets you tough
The kids at the club will rise above

The kids at the club (x4)

Anna knew of a little town
The walls are parted and broken down
And I fell in love as I jumped on the bus

Oh there are bugs right there on the side
But the bad booker kissed her and tried to hide
The world is so old and I felt so young

Hey hey hey I remember shouting to the top
Hey hey hey if I could snap my fingers
I could make the whole world stop

The kids in the club are hot enough
The kids at the club hold faintly enough
The kids at the club are falling in love

The kids in the club are hot enough
The kids in the club are faithly enough
The kids at the club will rise above

The kids at the club

I don't know what to do
In this world of pride
I'm feeling used
You, you left me this way
And in my heart I can't erase
The loving of her way

I don't realize what she means to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what you're trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on

Now will my heart feel complete?
Either way I avoid complete defeat
You, you can't hurt me this way
And in my heart I can't erase
The madness of my life

I don't realize what you mean to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what I'm trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on

She never understood
She never understood
She never understood

I don't realize what she means to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what she's trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on

I don't realize what she means to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what I'm trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on

She never understood

For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter that all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop

For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
For I have got another girl

You know I'm sinking slowly
You know I'm sleeping and lonely
Your clothes seem so sad on you
Red buttons because you're blue
Your old green sweater
I'm hanging up for you

If you ever walk out of my life
There'd be teardrops and heartaches
If you ever walk out of my life
There'd be sorrow and heartbreak
Teardrops and heartaches over you

Dancing close to midnight
Your Wilson Pickett moves, so right
Sitting here on the sofa
My red wine memories of you
I loved that flat so much
I wish you'd just sometimes come home

If you ever walk out of my life
There'd be teardrops and heartaches
If you ever walk out of my life
There'd be sorrow and heartbreak
Teardrops and heartaches over you

I'm sorry that I kissed you
These are the things that you love

You say you still care for me
A voice so full of pity
You underestimate
This feeling is loving, it's not hate
Your eyes seem sad on you
Remember, never forget

If you ever walk out of my life
There'd be teardrops and heartaches
If you ever walk out of my life
There'd be sorrow and heartbreak
Teardrops and heartaches over you

If you're like me you've tried everything
You're probably thinking to yourself

And like you I'm skeptical
Gave it a shot and so let me tell you

You're probably asking me is there nothing to lose and everything to gain
Everything to gain
Everything to gain

I guarantee my pledge to you
It was the best choice I've ever made

[Chorus]

I know
I know how you feel

I know
Everything to gain

Face in the gutter eyes on the floor
Knocked down twice can't take it no more
You got no vision in your head
You got no vision better dead
Get on your feet open the door

Walk on down you know the score
It's a dead-end street back to the wall
You get it together you can get it all

The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain (yeah)

No time for losers you make the call
Believe in yourself stand tall
Another day it's in your hand
You can be the winner in the end

The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain
No pain no gain (yeah)
No pain no gain (yeah, yeah)

Keep runnin' don't look back
Keep movin' paint it black
Keep goin' don't ever stop
There's time to rest the day you'll drop

You roll the dice you play the game
The weak will fall the strong remain

No pain no gain
No pain no gain

Let me stay for my time, baby
Never thought I'd see you cry, so
You wouldn't be so surprised baby if
You knew how much you let me down

You say you'll change eventually, baby
Oh, how can I forget the bad times
You're always saying sorry to me
So I can never stay around

Well, I'm leaving you behind me
'Cause you'll never find my hideaway
Won't come back tomorrow
Always low on time,
That you would like to treat me right
But it's not important

Never thought I would be tired of this scene
What about your good intentions?
Used to cry in my sleep
Did you ever stop to wonder why?

I even tried to smile at your friends
Those I can't stand, oh
I started believing
If I could only get through the night
Then tomorrow give it one more try

Well, I'm leaving you behind me
'Cause you'll never find my hideaway
Won't come back tomorrow
Always low on time,
That you would like to treat me right
But it's not important now

Baby, baby I really need you
Give me the strength to continue

I woke up on a perfect day but
There's nothing worse than being alone
Thought I must get somebody to save me
With a kick in the brain
And she wants to leave home

The sex and the parties
The way that we act
We wanted to change the world
We can throw away all the rules we despise
Lift up your lonely heart

Because because because
I get my strength from you
(and it's driving me crazy)
Because because because
I get my strength from you
(and it's driving me crazy)
Yes I do
(come on and help me then, baby)

From the cradle to the grave
My sweetheart and me will exist in between
Send messages in pressed leaves
Dressed up dance dance
We'll set ourselves free

We'll be just like Bonnie and Clyde
With love and hate on our hands
Anyone who knows what love
Is like will understand

What is this strange feeling
Is it insecurity?
We say we hate each other sometimes
But I'll keep trying if you'll keep trying
And underneath the tears I can see
The way you're looking at me
Yeah, and I can dig that

Walk it on! Yeah, yeah
Doo, doo, doo
Yeah, yeah

Because because because
I get my strength from you
(and it's driving me crazy)
Because because because
Because because because
Because because because
I get my strength from you
Yes, I do

Oh baby I really need you
Give me the strength to continue
Oh baby I really need you
Give me the strength to continue

What's becoming broken hearted
Nothing can stop us until we're parted
What's becoming broken-hearted
Nothing can stop us now

Just like the sun shining over the mountain top
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time
Watchin' sunlight dancing on your skin

I've never gone so wrong for telling lies to you
What you see is what I've been
There is nothing I can hide from you
You see me better than I ever can

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
Darlin' I only hope, only hope that you will hold me now
Until I gain control again

Just like the lighthouse I must stand alone
Landmarks to mark the sailors journeys end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
You know, you know I'll always roll this way, this way again

Out on the road that lies before me now
Surely there will be some turns where I will spin, spin
I only hope, I only hope that you, you will hold me now, hold me now
Till I gain, till I gain control, control again

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns, some turns where I will spin, spin
I only hope, only hope that you will hold me now, hold me now
Until I gain control again
Till I gain control

Too many miles behind me too many trials are through
Too many tears help me to remember but there's too much to gain to lose
Too many sunsets lie behind the mountains
Too many rivers my feet have walked through
And there's too many treasures awaiting over yonder
And there's too much to gain to lose
[ vibes ]
I crossed the hot burning desert struggling the right road to choose
Somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water and defeat is one word I'll never use
Too many sunsets lie behind the mountains...
Yes there's too much to gain to lose

It's pointless to explain why
There's nothing I can say
My words would all be meaningless
Anyway
It seems I can't be trusted
And I don't disagree
What made you think I ever really
Wanted to be?
I can't explain why
And I don't know when
I'm ever going to want to
See her again
Son don't ask why I came here
There's nothing I can say
I don't think I'll be staying very long
Anyway
I'm trying to find out why
I came here at all
I don't think it was to see you
After all

I don't want to die
Blinded by their eyes
And I don't want to be here
Right now, I don't explain

Right now, explain

Where you going?

Asking me the questions
And they don't have a clue
But I bought them lots of pencils
To write the times
You lose

I thought of something
I might say but
Try talking to someone
When that someone shares your name

I won't drag you down
I know, it's only rock and roll

If i could move the weight of everything
blind the skies and change the tomic role

here i am and not the answers

only scars can show this time

i'm still wandering round your door

how can i explain dear

you've been gone for some time

but i still believe you'll be here oh no

again.

There was a song
I remember
Said 'What the world
Needs now'

Where is the love
Where did it go
Who broke our hearts
'Cause we need to know
Where are the dreams
That we once knew?
Please explain
Please explain

Where is the love
Where did it go
Who broke our hearts
'Cause we need to know
Where are the dreams
That we once knew?
Please explain
Please explain

The sun and the moon are crying
The stars and our hearts crying
Please explain
The fathers and mothers are crying
Sisters and brothers crying
Please explain
Please explain

The sun and the moon are crying
The stars and our hearts are crying

I can't explain
Everyone keeps saying
Same thing
You must be sad

I guess I'll tell you
It's not the same thing
It took a while but I'm doing ok

We played a long time
We got along fine
And just like you I can't believe it's through.

Believe it.

Me and you.

I'm on my own now
I play alone now
I'd like to say that I'm kind of scared

What if I lose it
I've been known to panic
I make myself sick 'cause I've got bad nerves

I've got bad nerves.

Oh my nerves.

Oh there's a funny light
In the stars tonight
You and I will ride
All the factories
All the memories
Have changed
Will you work it out?
Will you see that I'm going no where else?
I don't know where you
Think and start again
But I, I know in all we've said
I finally know how it began
It's nothing that I can even explain
Til we begin tonight
Is it a righteous fight?
The sentiment's not right
Will you work it out?
Will you sell it all
To find me?
All the weapons are
Finally coming out
But now you see that I
Only wanted to
Have it out with you

Remember our love
Whoa but in the coldest light you see
You see what you want
And you break it all
Find it somewhere else
You say that our love
Can't be a baton in your part
You say that our love
You say that our love
Is only mat
Ooooh look above you now
There's a heavy cloud
Hanging over us
All the factories
All inflameries
Are closed
Do you wake at night
Wishing you'd relied on someone else?
I don't know what you
Think you find again
But I, I know in all we've said
I finally found where I'll begin
It's something I can't even explain

Hush now, don't explain

Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

It's not the barley or the wheat
It's not the oven or the heat
That makes this bread so good to eat
It's the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete

Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

Upon the water prayed his cast
The last is first, the first is last
For everyone who eats this bread
There are thousands maybe more that will be fed

Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

Breaking bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

Sleeping at night in a plaster board box
Scratching the earth with the nails on my fingers
And the ground pukes up rocks and rocks and more rocks
And when the seeds finally reach the ground
It's all been for nothing
I hear the cries of children at night
I watch their faces grow sallow with hunger
Who draws the line between what's wrong and right
And when I ask my life is for
It's all been for nothing
Save your regrets for the dead, but for the living
Give them love and give them bread
One more hungry mouth to be fed
Remember the living
Give them love, give them bread
Standing in the light of the kitchen screen door
Like some kind of untouchable stuck in Calcutta
I almost forget what I'm standing here for
And I don't know what to do but I know
I won't leave with nothing
Where are the days when life was carefree
Why must I suffer this, what was my crime
Begging or thievery, which shall it be
Is there no other choice for me
I can't live with nothing
Justice only comes to the dead
And when they ask me what life is for
I must give them something

I look into my morning mirror
And it reveals some things to me that I had not been able to see
I saw someone that I'm not sure I want to be
An empty lonely face was starin' back at me

All and all, I would have to say
It's been a rather dismal day

The afternoon was slow in coming
I drug myself outside the face that people that I knew would be there
And though they walked along pretending not to care
I knew behind my back they'd point and laugh and stare

All and all, I would have to say
It's been a rather dismal day

And now the evening shadow's falling
I guess it's best I lay my hopes to rest for no one's calling my name
I sit and wait behind a door that's never knocked on
I live in silence like my phone that's never talked on

All and all, I would have to say
It's been a rather dismal day
All and all, I would have to say
It's been a rather dismal day
All and all, I would have to say
It's been a rather dismal day

I know the times the times are hard to bear
It's hard to find someone to really care
But before I went down and out
Here's what I used to think about, think about

London bridge is always fallin' down,
But there it stood within the heart of town
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come

The changes taking place are everywhere
The centuries past have nothing to compare
Where they stand, where they trip and fall
Watch the writing on the wall, on the wall

London bridge is fallin' down at last,
And so another memory of the past
Has fell beneath the blade, but soon the dead may be repaid

I know things just can't evolve for all eternity
The thoughts will leave, will never die, and now so you can see

London bridge is finally fallin' down,
It packed it up and shipped it outta town
And though the horror's gone, the memory will linger on
London bridge is finally fallin' down,
It used to stand within the heart of town
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come
London bridge is finally fallin' down

I'm driftin' down the street
Asking of all i meet
Don't you know me from somewhere
Hazel eyes and curly hair
Have you seen me anywhere
Look at me
I'm blending into the wall
And i wonder if i'm really here at all

Time goes by
So do i
But no one blinks an eye
Mirrors aren't reflecting me
Laws aren't protecting
And no one's expecting me
On the edge
I feel like i'm going to fall
And i wonder if i'll never land at well

Loneliness comes and stays
Torturing nights and days
People stare but cannot speak
Hearts are strong
But tongues are weak
Maybe all our minds are meek
Look at me
I'm fading into the floor
And wonder if i'm living anymore.





Hey, didn't you believe me when I told you I was leaving?
Well, wait a little while and soon you will be believing
I'm telling you now like I told you before
That love has got to be something more
Than a pastime, this is the last time

[Chorus]
This is the last time that I will say goodbye
You say it doesn't mean a thing
Let's see what the future brings
In the past, I've changed my mind, but
This has got to be the last time

Well, didn't you believe it when I said you don't know how to love me?
You, you never understood that you weren't so high above me
I didn't realize 'til a moment ago
That time doesn't really go this slow
And it's past time, this is the last time

[Chorus]

What you gonna do when nights are getting colder, baby?
Where ya gonna go, you know you're getting older, baby?
Guess you're gonna have to be a little bolder, baby
What you gonna do to satisfy your hunger, baby?
Oh, don't it seem that everyone's a-getting younger, baby?
Guess you're gonna have to find yourself another pastime
Judging from the past, I know it won't be the last time

[Chorus]

Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your life
Don't shut the door, shut the door, door on my life
You been locking apart of your love away
You been holding out on me
I just want to get down deep inside of you

So that I can set you free
Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your mind
Don't be afraid, be afraid, afraid of what I might find
I would never be judge you for what you are
You can say what's in your heart
It's the things that you're hiding that bother me
And it's keeping us apart so
If you really love me like you like to say you
Really do

Gotta open up and let the rest of you come
Shining through
Don't shut me out, shut me out of your life
Don't lock the door, lock the door, door on my life
Such a beautiful thing we could come to know
If you'll only trust in me
I just want to get down deep inside of you
So that I can set you free and
Turn you loose so you can see, so

Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your life and
Don't shut the door, shut the door, door on your
Sweet, sweet, yeah

Don't be afraid, be afraid, afraid of what I might find, no
Don't lock the door, lock the door, door on your
Sweet, sweet mind.

The silken skies that so remind and mesmerize
And finally blind me
The downy softness of herself forever lingering
Behind me
Never ever has there been
Nor will ever be again
One someone to give you love, tenderness and be
Your friend
Hanging on till the bitter end
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost
But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.

I've tried to look inside myself
To find the strength from which to draw from
The view she saw from.
Since she tried to go too deep
Limitations brought her down
And though I'd like to free her mind
Visitations bring a frown
I gotta find the place she found
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost
But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.
Where she is no one seems to know
The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.

The morning mist that melts upon the meadow
Brings a touch of sorrow
The one I kissed is all alone
And may or may not know tomorrow.
Just an ordinary girl
To the ordinary eye
But so much deeper goes the vein
Like the glittering of gold you want to touch
Then you gotta hold
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost.

It don't matter to me
If you really feel that
You need sometime to be free
Time to go out searching for yourself
Hoping to find time to go to find

And it don't matter to me
If you take up with someone
Who's better than me
'Cause your happiness is all I want
For you to find peace your piece of mind

Lotta people have an eager hang up
'Cause they want to be the only one
How many came before it really doesn't matter
Just as long as you're the last
Everybody's moving on and try to find out
What's been missing in the past

And it don't matter to me
If your searching brings you back together with me
'Cause there'll always be
An empty room waiting for you
An open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side
'Cause it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me

Friends and lovers
Saying goodbye to each other
Their way
Your way

Gathered in garden and parting in doorways
And it's over
Anyway that's what the papers said.
And I wonder

What was going on inside your head
You were there
You were there
I'd like to ask

Did anybody touch you?
Come and go it went so fast
Did anybody touch you?
Friends and lovers

Turning away from the others
Your way
Their way
Closing their doors and then climbing their

Stairways
And it's over
Anyway that's what the people say and I wonder
Does it really have to be this way

You were there
You were there I'd like to ask
Did anybody touch you.
Come and go it went so fast

Did anybody touch you.
Come and go it went so fast
Did anybody touch you?
Or did you stand alone until the darkness came

Just one more room where everybody knew
Your name.
Friends and lovers
Ever apart from others

Endless hallways
Just say goodbye and it's over for always
And it's over
Didn't you believe me when I said and I wonder

What was going on inside your head
You were there
You were there I'd like to ask
Did anybody touch you?

Come and go it went so fast
Did anybody touch you?

Sure gets funny thinkin' 'bout money
Makin' my daily bread,
The more you make, the more they take
You never seem to get ahead,
You break your backs just to pay your tax
Then you don't like the way that it's spent,
Somewhere back we jumped the track
This isn't what the governmeant...

Bet my now I've made a hundred thou
But I ain't saved a dime,
The IRS came out best
They got my money every time,

It can't be fair when the millionaire
Never has to give them a cent,
Sad to say we've lost the way
This isn't what the governmeant ...

Then the war , don't know what for
Somebody said it had to be fought,
I'se sposed to go but I said no
'Cause I'se afraid I might get shot,
but here I am on my hands and knees
scrubbin' in my dungarees
I got burned but I finally learned
This isn't what the governmeant





If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.

If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away

You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew,
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What a time, what a time
You never said too much,
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you

Nobody else could ever know,
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own,
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know,
Your loving them so,
But taking them all for granted?
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away,
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own,
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again;
Just to touch you once again

Welcome To The Music
Bread
(David Gates)

Welcome to the music - welcome to the Guitar man
Know you're gonna love it - gonna do the best we can
And to help us along - think we're gonna need us a band

Lately we been playin' - travelin' in the jets and cars
Smilin' at the people - lookin'at the rock and roll stars
I tell you Carnegie Hall's better than those honky tonk bars

Well if it's true what music can do
To soothe the savage beast like they say
Well just relax and lie on your backs
'Cause beastly is the way we play

Now we're through talkin' - gonna speak another day
Love to play it funky - love to hear the symphony
And to star us along - Larry's gonna play it in "see"
Don't touch that dial - won't you come and stay for awhile.

Tecolote
Bread
(David Gates)

Voodoo woman made a doll of me
And ever since then I been in misery
She said I did her pretty little daughter bad
And ever since then she's been driving me mad

Let me go, let me go, Tecolote
Set me free, let me be, Tecolote

Drums keep beatin' in my head all night
Poltergeists knockin' on my left and right
Pain and a fever running 103
Just because her daughter wants to marry me

Rather die, rather die than get married
Let me go, tell her no, tell her no

You heard my story and you now know why
A strange old woman makes a grown man cry
And next time a pretty pretty  turns your head
You better take a look at her mother instead

Let me go, let me go, Tecolote
Let me be, set me free, let me free

'Cause you are the bread
And it's never work
And warm, buttered is good
Oh, let's just digest

And the dishes are fine
They're not goin' nowhere
So keep your hands soft
For high fives and shakes

And the bathroom's a mess
Tomorrow we'll clean
And my window won't shut
But the breeze does feel nice

And the stove can be years
To light cigarettes
Oh, let the tablecloth burn
It's pretty that way

'Cause you smell like bread
And now the pillow does too
'Cause everyone left
With a even hue

Baby, I'm-a want you
Baby, I'm-a need you
You the only one I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'm-a crazy
But I just can't live without...

Your lovin' and affection
Givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour
Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why...

Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh
And made me cry...
You taught me why...

Baby, I'm-a want you
Baby, I'm-a need you

Oh, it took so long to find you, baby
Baby, I'm-a want you
Baby, I'm-a need you

Greed

Do you know your neighbor's name
Join the rest who feel the same
Who can really hear your call
If they're out to see you fall
Greed
Greed
One too many is a crowd
Only plenty is allowed
Fe fi fo fum
Can't forget from where you come
Greed
Greed
Love is more than just a smile
It will last you for a while
All to win in war is peace
Let the people live at least
Greed
Greed

Who's got what's his face to blame
You don't even know his name
If the shoe fits oh beware
You might sometimes be unfair
Greed
Just little greed
Greed
Greed
Some of us will go astray
We can't always get our way
So tighten up and bear the cross
Lighten up and share the loss
Greed
Talk about greed
Greed
Just a little too greedy
Oh yeah
Fe fi fo fum
Don't forget from where you come
Greed
Greedy
Greed
One more time greed
Greedy
Greed
Talking about greedy

Now if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard
I ain't fuckin' with it
This cake has got to be all icing baby
Now I know I'm taking the biggest piece
But god damn I'm the biggest fish with the biggest mouth bitch
You want to be rich right? (Hell yeah)
Well stick with me do as I does  and be as I be
We be stackin' chips packin' clips mackin' chicks
Laugh at tits slappin' dick  in yo' bitch (bitch!)
Makin' hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
Walkin slow, there go the po', now here we go
Parking lot to the spot, Marriott
Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
Who's at the do', go and check, I got the Tec
Tell him that you soakin' wet, until he jet
Now lift up your fuckin' dress, where's the rest
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts
Uh-huh strip search, whip skirts
Uh-huh shit hurts, but it works bitch
You can jerk niggas but you can't jerk me
Hoe I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
I'm talkin' greed

Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
We smokin weed, you and me
Lookin for that currency
We smokin weed, you and me
Lookin for that currency

Now bitch niggas don't mean shit, from where I sit
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
Surround the airport with feds and helicopters
Escorted, detained and deported
Scared of the lyrics, and when they bitches hear us
We the clear-est, you can fear us
Smile on the day of your disappearance, smoke in mirrors
Break em all, pull over and jump out
Cause I can take em all, all bustas shake em all
I'm at the mall, buyin' shit, like hot dog on a stick
These bitches all on the dick
Ice Cube ain't a lick (nope) make me bleed
And now you got to deal with the niggas that I feed, greed

(Give me more, give me more) Greed, Greed
When you get your hands on it, want to fawn it
Want to dance on it, everybody want it
(Give me more, give me more) Greed, Greed
When you get your hands on it, want to fawn it
Want to dance on it, everybody want it

You punks is petty, still we steady, countin' fetti
I'm the one closin' escrow, with the best flow
(Do you wear a vest?) No
Niggas hit me I'ma turn into The Crow *caw caw* and take a shit
On everything counterfeit, the Don Mega
Blade Runner, in a beige Hummer all summer
It'd take about twelve honkeys, to convict
The nigga makin' you sick, ask the 12 Monkeys
Up in Detroit holdin' weed court, all through the South
Picked up a ounce in Shreveport
My lead give head tunnels (boom!)
To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Worldwide, international jet set
My niggas love fuckin' bitches that they just met
Get it wet, and you can do anything
When I'm in Paris niggas french-kiss the pinky ring

Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
We smokin weed, you and me
Lookin for that currency

Had it all wanted more so you got you some fast cash to keep you rollin
Credit cards slit your throat now it won't let go
Yeah you've gotta get out before it takes control
It's a big black hole it'll swallow your soul

When greed is all that motivates
You'll hang yourself and seal your fate

And you'll go down swinging from an old tree
Suicide of the worst degree
It'll be too late to get yourself free
Cause you'll be too far down
Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed
To get your silver to feed your greed
Oh it's a deadly so don't let it in

For what it's worth everything on the earth's not enough
To keep you going
What you want never need only fuels you're greed
Yeah, you gotta get out before it takes control
It's a big black hole that'll swallow your soul

Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed
To get your silver to feed your greed
Oh it's a deadly sin don't let it in

All the pennies in your pockets
Won't get you through the needles eye
The one thing that you're needing
Money just can't buy

And you'll go down swinging from an old tree
Suicide of the worst degree
It'll be too late to get yourself free

greed for cash causes your blindness
creates obsession for might and fame
guide the flames for the endless time
unleashes your desire

greed - obsession - it burns in you
desire - for more and more
greed - obsession attracts a new
desire - for more and more

your inner addiction destroys your life
not noticed your brain eaten back to life
contaminates your thoughts
destroys your life more and more

desire makes you mindless
it kills every emotion in your heart
releases the pressure from your soul
estranged from society of man

Everything you see you always think you need
You are so crazy motivated by greed
You never take responsibility
You only waste your time when you fuck with me

All you do is take you see my hatred grows
Can't take much more I'm about to explode
You'll see a side Of me I've never shown
You'll feel pain like you've never known

Got enough but you want it all
In it for greed now you're gonna fall
Here we come gonna ruin your day
Time has come It's your turn to pay

The mighty dollar is your only care
You're movin' up but you're going nowhere
You say you only want to get your share
But you still want more no you won't play fair

You'll never ever quit you won't be denied
You sit and watch your money multiply
To get what you want you'll cheat and lie
But I know - you won't be satisfied

Today is a good day for suffering

We are living in search of
The American dream
Based on the almighty dollar
Oh! How we wheel, deal and scheme
Pray to God you get your share
There's no rainbow it's not there - No oh! oh!

We're all stealing and cheating
Work yourself 'til you bleed
This is the way of the dollar
No one is immune to the greed
Pray to God you get your share
No pot of gold it's not there - No oh! oh!

For greed we live
In need we die
Your life's a circle
We live and die for something that we'll never have
For greed!

For greed you live
In need you die
Your life's a circle
You live and die for something that you'll never have
For greed! For greed! For greed!

Over the hills they came from the valley
Making innuendos about my lack of talent, oh well
They say that when I'm supposed to be singing
All I 'm really doing is yelling, oh well
To you I say

Break out or get out
Then they say that I can't sing
That I don't say a thing
That I make everything up oh well
To you I say

Break out or get out
Break out or get out

Get out of your mind
'Cause it's much too small
And there's so much going on

Force yourself on me.
I know where my money comes from.
I'll do anything for you.
When your hands in my mouth I'll force it down.

I'll force it down in me.
Hold it in, take it out of me.
Push me, I'll move.
I'll do anything for you

I Mean Nothing To Myself.
I Mean Nothing To Myself.
I'm Nothing, I'm Nobody.
I Hate My Body, I'm Stuck In Myself.

I'm Nothing, I'm Nobody.

Deep ocean vast sea
Your ocean heart
Clothed in respect
And sweet caress
My uneasy mind
You dip and you swell
Float and you find
And sweet caress
My uneasy mind

Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's deep

Imagine set of steps easily climbed
The tower of pride
The plastic of mind
Where there lies a table
The table stands
For the power of success
Respect on the sign
Intelligence so cold
A heart like glass
From the surface to deep
You wave and you dive
Like the heart and the sun
You wave and you dive
You hold me so cold
You wave and you dive

Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's me

You're clothed in respect
You smell of sweet caress
Dip and swell beyond the power of fists
Your ocean heart
Healing uneasy minds
And I want to dive in with you
Clinging to the rock, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting

Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's deep

Your heart is hard
You think your legs hurt
You smell of aching sweet success
Your head's a supernova
And you would like
Anything to stop the pain from your fingers
Screaming
And you stand naked in the sun
Without leather
Whose pain you think you need
Well all you need to do is undress
Let go and wash
Take the step through the other side
Up-turned razor
The air is thick with karma
A sutra of the way down
Well listen boy it's a long way down
Down through heaven's gate
To heaven's gate the step's the step
The tower of pride
The devil lied
Dive up to the highest poi

Days, how many days
Do I have until
I am set free
To a better place
A place of love
A place of no tomorrows
Release me from this need I have of me
Hours, how many hours
Do I have until
I am set free
To a better place
A place of love
A place of no misery
Release me from this need I have of me
When will you believe me
When I say these things to you
No one likes a liar baby
No one at all
When will you receive me
When I say these things to you
No one likes a liar baby
No one at all
I guess I have something to look forward to
I guess I have something to look forward to
I guess I have something to look forward to

Burdens of grief that weigh against me
Aid my tired eyes in their search for pitch
Your kinds heart now pines
For whom the gods love dies young
Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears
The sadness I present, smiles with tears
Where once I'd loved now lied forlorn beauty
And wars abhorred by mothers

No man lives so poor as he was born
We don't remember pure sensations
Gaze peacefully into the past
I am dust , and to dust I shall return
Belial, Mephisto, both shall burn me up
Devour my sad whimperings
The cutting whip is mine to feel
No symphony in mind to colour my dreams

Poena damni
Sorrow everywhere
Please pray for me
When deep sleep falls on men
Father hold me
I am yours to bear
Ad te

In the play which he has written for the world
Night is the mother of sleep
Old age is a malady of which one dies
Augury of a better age
Sages as far as the beard
Their wounds smelled so sweetly
Temptation, the father of my lust
Chalcedony shines like the new born

Stricken I'd raise my dripping limbs
Splendid was the innocentcs fall
Laugh to scorn would our foe
Amid wars laws are silent
Drop by drop in sleep upon the heart
Falls the labrious memory of pain
In the rich upheavel of vast choirs
Death shall flee from me

Misericordium et judicium
Adhoest pavimento
AD te levavi ocolus meos
Verba mea auribus

It's time to luagh,it's time to cry
It's time to be what you need to be
It won't be long 'til they are gone
And we can be what we want to be

I'm gonna run from everything
Everything that holds me down
Nothing to win, nothing to lose
You can't tell me what to do anymore

You can't tell me what to do anymore
Now I'm free, Now I'm free, Now I'm free
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna win
I'm gonna do what I need to do

'Cause it's time to be what I need to be
You can't tell me what to do anymore
You can't tell me what to do anymore
Now I'm free, Now I'm free, Now I'm free

I want hold air in my hand
Own the one thing you can't buy
Nothing to win, nothing to lose
I'm gonna run from everything

Everything that holds me down
Nothing to win, nothing to lose
It's time to be what I need to be
You can't tell me what to do anymore

You can't tell me what to do anymore
Now I'm free, now I'm free, Now I'm free

Touched,
You say that I am too,
So much,
Of what you say is true,

I'll never find someone quite like you,
Again,
I'll never find someone quite like you,
Like You,

The razors and the dying roses,
Plead I don't leave you alone,
The demi-gods and hungry ghosts,
God, god knows I'm not at home,

I'll never find someone quite like you,
Again,
I'll never find someone quite like you,
Again,

I looked into your eyes and
Saw a world that does not exist,
I looked into your eyes and,
Saw a world I wish I was in,

I'll never find someone quite as touched as you
I'll never love someone quite the way that I loved you.

You're made of my rib or baby
You're made of my sin
And I can't tell where
Your lust ends
And where your love begins

I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you
I didn't want to hurt you
But you're pretty when you cry

And the moon gives me
Permission and I enter
Through her eyes
She's losing her virginity and
All her will to compromise

I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you
I didn't want to hurt you
But you're pretty when you cry

I didn't want to fuck you baby
I didn't want to fuck you
I didn't want to fuck you
But you're pretty
When you're mine

I didn't really love you baby
I didn't really love you
I didn't really love you
But I'm pretty when I lie

You hurt me baby
I hurt you baby

If you knew how much I love you
You would run away
But when I treat you bad
It always makes you want to stay

I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby

I want the key to your heart

You tell me that you need
My loving
But when you gonna
Give me the key
To the basement
Every other lover
You had before
Got a key to the door

You say you're gonna
See me on Sunday
But when you gonna
Give me the key to your heart
All of my friends
Have walked down the aisle
Now we're miles apart

They say that love is often blind
And I'm blind I'm blind
I know I'm blind
They say that love will fool us all
And I'm fooled I'm fooled I know I'm fooled

I want the key to your heart

You tease me cos you know I need you
But how much waiting
Can one girl do for
One boy
To look at your now
Why am I waiting at all

I want the key to your heart

Somewhere there is a key
It is laid behind the golden trail
To open even me, even for the last fires glow
Somewhere there is a door
It is closed forever more
All the little things we swore allegiance to
Just between me and you

Somewhere here is a place
Where the heart meets face to face
With the whole human race
Before the last shadows falls
Somewhere there is no time
Common ground on earths recline
Where we will open and find
A shakes the line to be or not to be
Just between you and me

Somewhere there is a chance
To escape from tribal dance
No one breaks the common trance, of global glance
At freedoms plate
Somewhere there are no lies
The truth and beauty still survives
And all the days of our lives
The sun rise, just to show us the way
Just between you and me

Just between you and me
Just between you and me
Just between you and me

John is nineteen, and he doesn't see the matter
Of Judas' saddest dream, reaching for the piece of silver
Peter hears the call of the mockingbird from heaven
Crying in the morning, having given up the key

And I still call him my friend
And I still call him my friend

Joshua puts on his mask and walks the road to Jericho
Matthew wears the head piece of chrome, speed and fire
Noah guides the ark through the sea of stolen moments
Searching through his mind for a place to put the key

And I still call him my friend
And I still call him my friend

Joseph tends the sheep in his coat of many colors
Shadrach and the two held their faith against the fire
Barabbas' on the cross, found that Jesus was the answer
The doors were open wide to all those who find the key

And we still call him our friend
And we still call him our friend
And we still call him our friend

And we still call him our friend
And we still call him our friend
And we still call him our friend

Shut the fuck up, you shut the fuck up
Who the fuck are you, who the fuck are you?
(I ain't nobody)
That's the question, the question at hand
Oh, man, fuck this, fuck this
(I ain't nobody)

You know, I lost my place a long time ago
About fifty fucking rhymes ago
I'm wrecking again
I'm seriously considering checking myself in

Locked inside this key chamber
There's millions of keys inside
But only one can stop my anger
And I'm not fading away, so I'll just have to die

Unlocking the doors in my mind
How many doors will I find?
I think I got the key
I guess I'll just try another if that's the key

I'd love to hear my daddy play once again
All the songs that he taught me when I was a kid
John Henry, Ol' Shep and Faded Love
I Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A Dove

Just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew
But in the eyes of a child, man his fingers flew
I practiced and I practiced til I got it right
Packed up everything and just took off one night

I made it from the beer joints to the Opry stage
He said the only difference is what you're gettin' paid
He didn't care that everybody knew my name
He said it's all for nothin' if you don't stay the same

But when he died the preacher cried and said he's the lucky one
He's walkin' hand in hand in hand with God's only son
My faith and common sense tell me the preacher's right
But I'd love to hear the banjo ring for me tonight

And I will honor my father with these words I write down
As long as I remember him he'll always be around
And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life

And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life

You was with me ma when I first copped my deal
Bought you the 5 karats plus the house on the hill
The blue escalade with them new chrome-e wheels

Sometimes I glow inside, other times you made me cry
Tell me what, am I to do, I'm so confused

Tell me who, tell me what, tell me when

Like a steppin' razor
The Brother Tosh 'im come aroun'
Yellow Man and Eek-A-Mouse
Dem a trod 'pon newer groun'
While Scratch and The Scientist
Dem jus' keep on mixin' down.

The mighty General and Eastwood

The Lone Ranger ride in
To rock me' pon me feet
The dreaded Flabba Holt and Style Scott
Start fe put down a radical beat
Wid Mistra Isaacs
Puttin' melodies so sweet.

Ad lib.......
Reggae music is
The key to ny heart
Reggae music is
My stop and start
From dusk to dawn
The music is my high.

Each time that I hold you, your eyes fill with fear,
You can't lose control now, the price is too dear,
But love, I have heard you crying in the dark,
And the tears on your pillow came bleeding, weeping from your heart.

Oh sinner, you're losing all that you had,
Your day is in peaces, your night has gone mad,
And love cannot touch you, the search has no end,
And the one you've forgotten was really your only friend

Then your soul flies to Heaven,
You reach out for me,
But the door will not open,
You've thrown away the key;
No the door will not open,
You've thrown away the key

Oh stranger beware the life that you lead,
Is filled with the warnings you can or will not read;
Your castle has fallen, it lies in the sand,
I heard your voice calling, I thought I felt the brush of your hand

Oh gambler remember the love that you lend,
Will never come back for the game has no ending;
The smiler is calling, you turn for the deal,
And the aces keep falling with every spin of the wheel;

Then you gather your winnings,
You're ready to leave,
But the door will not open,
You've thrown away the key,
Oh there's no point in staying,
So don't wait to see,
For the door will not open,
You've thrown away the key

Oh jealous me and careless you the odds were just too great
I couldn't take those lonely nights you made me sit and wait
I thought I'd seen the last of you when you walked out of sight
Instead I see you in my dreams each night
So the key's in the mailbox come on in
I'm sitting here wishing dear I had your love again
I'll never even ask you where you've been the key's in the mailbox come on in
[ steel - fiddle ]
I said I'd rather be alone than share your company
I said don't come around at all if you want more than me
But sitting here alone I can't deny the flame that burns
I'd gladly take you back on any terms
So the key's in the mailbox...

You're climbing mountains, I'm on a hill
You're always running I'm standing still
You live for the moment, no future no past
I may be a fool to love by the rules and want it to last

If you ever have forever in mind
I'll be here and easy to find
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine
If you ever have forever in mind

The music has ended still you want to dance
I know that feeling, I can't take that chance
You live for the moment no future no past
I may be a fool to love by the rules, I want it to last

If you ever have forever in mind
I'll be here and easy to find
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine
If you ever have forever in mind

Don't come cryin' to me when it's over
Don't you come knockin'' at my door
Don't come cryin' to me I won't be waiting
Like I've done a hundred times before

You promised you'd love me forever
Now it's all over town you've changed your mind
You'll call me and say "let's get together"
But I'm sorry I won't take you back this time

Don't come cryin' to me when it's over
Don't you come knockin'' at my door
Don't come cryin' to me I won't be waiting
Like I've done a hundred times before

Like I've done a hundred times before

[Chorus]
Well I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye
You said it's finally over, here's the reasons why
You said you've heard enough of all those little lies
I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye

I thought I made you happy but you've proved me wrong
I thought I was the one that really turned you on
When I came home tonight all my things were gone
I guess gettin' over me didn't take you long


Well, you said you'd heard enough of all those little lies
I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye
No I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye

Come on in and take your coat off
Come on in and sit down
If I seem a little nervous
I've been walkin' shaky ground

I've been alone since she left me
And I'm not quite sure what to do
So if I call her name I'm sorry
It's all those years are hard to lose

[Chorus]
All those years with just one woman
Was all gone in just a day
All those years with just one woman
Makes it hard to try to find a brand new way
After all those years

I guess I should take down her picture
And try to put your mind at ease
And tell myself it's really over
And put aside this misery

[Chorus]

Well I just found the fence where I am going to lean
Take my handkerchief out and rub my eyeglasses clean
So I just learned my face, but I forgot my name
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's some stupid toupee
And say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's too bad"

Oh, I just learned your face, but it is bound to change
You can say what you want but try to think it my way
And say, "Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign"
I said, "Oh, oh, oh, this was not my plan"

Well, you know I'm a bastard and we only just met
I guess I probably shouldn't wear this big old sign 'round my neck
I've still got some opinions that I'm willing to claim
I'm gonna carry them around like they're some wicked campaign

I started the debate, but now I'm sure I can't win
I should probably just exit the same way I came in
Well counted calculator, you didn't calculate this
But there's a lot more nothing than you knew exists

Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign
I said, "Oh, oh, oh, this was not my plan"
Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign
Every day is a wicked campaign

Well, I just found the fence where I am going to lean
Take my handkerchief out and rub my eyeglasses clean

And just wait
And just wait and wait, wait, wait

I'm not dead but I misplaced the will
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's a hundred dollar bill
And just wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

I'm not a doctor, but I'll sell you an itch
I could apologize, but then a bit more nothing exists
So the worlds got plenty of good and bad liars
But our lies should come with chariots and choirs

Singing, "Oh, oh, oh, things are not so bad"
And we sing, "Oh, oh, oh, it's our wicked campaign"
And they sing, "Oh, oh, oh, things are not so bad"
We sing, "Oh, oh, oh, what a wicked campaign"

The dirty tricks department is working overtime
Trying to stop the candidate from getting this time
The wheels are now in motion all the traps are set
Under this commotion will he walk into this mess

The state's intoxicated they're at the starting gate
He may never make it to the planned TV debate
He can't fight off the big bucks of the old brigade
He's gotta watch his step in this smear campaign

They called a snap election in the summer heat
This town is reeling backwards like a drunk man on the streets
Feed those lies, bend those minds at any price
Foul or air as long as he's not there election time

Don't believe the papers it's not any body's race
He's not a rank beginner it's not a children's game
He may get the nomination if he breaks through the chain
Or they'll shoot him down on main street in this smear campaign

Just watch the party faithful fuel the dream machine
They've fudged up all the issues eat that scandal sheet
The dirty tricks department is nearly half insane
Trying to stop the candidate with a smear campaign

There's a campaign of hate
Its waiting at the school gates
For what I am not aware
Whisper what you wrote
What you write, you swore and you swear

Now remember why you came
Not to play follow the leader, no no

Poor kids dressing like they're rich
Rich kids dressing like they're poor
White kids talking like they're black
I tried it with Charlene
And I spent three days on my back

But she said baby
I like the cut of your J.I.B.
Don't believe them when they say
That you don't get nothing for free

Hate, war and terror, murder, disaster
Rape, drugs and violence, lost in our failure
Fear is suffering, intimidate to obey
Fear is control, suffering is hell
Police enforce obedient behavior
Manufactured weapon of conformity
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?

It is the most strategic tool used to manipulate
Intimidation to make me weak in order to obey
Strategy to manipulate, paralyze, intimidate
Righteous greed suffocates, a powerful fear campaign
Mind killing, restricting
Fear is the enemy on my path
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
Fear is your God

The nurse is on her knees
Doctor is a junky
Intensity's incredible
With feelings of an animal
So much to adore can't take in anymore

What a way to go you say
Well solid kid keep your head
Or else she just might wind up dead

We give into
The things we crave
It crashes down
Like a tidal wave
Cutting off the circulation
Its time to say good-bye to this one

What a way to go you say
Well solid kid don't loose your head
Or else he just might wind up dead

What a way to go you say
Well solid kid keep your wits
And by the end of this day well all be rich

Liposuction, augmentation, brow lift and a dermabrasion
Rhinoplasty, mastopexy, calf implants and brachioplasty
And now for some sex appeal
Don't forget the chemical peel
Never had to go to school
Just bop pills and cut up fools

What a way to go you say
Well solid kid keep your head
Or else that thing might wind up dead

What a way to go you say
Well solid kid don't loose your wits
And by the end of this day well all be rich

One place for all this distance
We've got so displaced
The life that you've always wanted
A thousand miles away

Like no man's like an architect
Like moving in one place
We can live forever
We could fade away

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

Now I have your attention
It's just a matter of time
Till you question what I'm saying
Make me justify

Every word in every line
That does not seem to fit
But the meaning's not so important
As long as you mean it

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

The life that I wanted
Is frozen in motion
The life that I wanted
Is frozen in motion

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

Borrowed time and missing faces
No home in a million places
I don't want a change of pace
I can't do anything else

I can't do anything else
I can't do anything else
I can't do anything else

Don't try so hard to be different
The cracks are beginning to show
You drift like a cloud through the festival crowd
In a frock coat from Seville row

You've just been to a all night party
Where I have to admit it takes pluck
To go out on the floor and proclaim, ?What a bore?
In a T-shirt that reads, 'Disco Sucks'

Yes, here he comes, the not so young
Pretender to the throne
He's singing rag, momma, rag
Won't you give that poor dog a bone?

And he's wondering why we can't connect
When he's sworn to us that he's totally wretch
On the rustic charm that he affects
On a public schoolboy whim

With a raggle taggle plastic gypsy
Robert Zimmerframe
With a synthesized accordion
A scramblin' up my brain

With a fiddle dee dee, a fiddle on high
Excuse me folks while I kiss the sky
Or at any rate give it one more try
Before I die, before I die

The overrated hit the stage
Overpaid and over here
And their idea of counter culture's
Momma's charge account at sears

And they're wondering why we can't connect
With the ritual of the trashed guitar
One more paltry empty gesture
The ashes of a burned out star

Yes, here they come, both old and young
A contact low or high
The gathering of the tribes descending
Vultures from a caustic sky

The rotting carcase of July
And ugly sun hung out to dry
Your gorgeous hippy dreams are dying
Your frazzled brains are putrefying

Repackaged, sold and sanitized
The devil's music exorcised
You live, you die, you lie, you lie, you die
Perpetuate the lie, perpetuate the lie,
Perpetuate the lie, just to perpetuate the lie

Yes, yes, yes, it's the summer festival
The truly detestable summer festival
Yes, yes, yes, it's the summer festival

Blindness feeds the world to madness
Faith's crumbling, there's no doubt about it
Religion and science fighting a new kind of war

Helpless wander the streets in desperation
Fearless to the path they tread
Shameless the powers that butcher
Ignorant to the deeds that they commit

When all is said and done
Heaven lies in my heart
No slave to beliefs that propagate pain
When all is said and done
Heaven lies in our hearts
This life is a gift to be lived and loved

Fracturing the structure of nature
Iconic catalysts to slaughter
A stalemate bursting bound by contradictions

Heartless divine blueprints of hatred
Selfless Diseased master plans
Shameless the powers that butcher
Ignorant to the deeds that they commit

Decoded treachery shielding the tyranny
Black Bible tyrants behind masks of righteousness
Relentless the onslaught of misunderstanding
Descending into a unified chaos

One more chance for a shot at redemption
Lost within, can we summon the might?

S c h o o l, you got to go to school and beat that bell.
E-mail, what goes here? ________and ring, ding, dong.
We e-mail, what goes here? __________ rap about this song.

Well listen.
When I was very young I used to sit around the house watching oil can harry battle mighty mouse
Until my mother said, son, that's not the way to be. you've got to go to school and learn your abcs.
I said, is that it, mom?
She said, that's not even half. you've got to go to school, you got to learn some math.
You got to learn you to count- 1, 2, 3- and then get freshed up on the history.
My first day of school I'll never forget. my teacher said, recite the alphabet.
I said, a e m e l r, and, as you can see, I didn't get very far.
The teacher said, son, there's nothing to it. before the day's over, you'll learn how to do it.
And not only that, you'll learn how to read, and that's one thing in life you'll always need.
Well, school's not all work. there's fun things to do like gym, lunch, and recess, too.
Kindergarten was easy. it was mostly play. what I was worried about was elementary.

S c h o o l, you got to go to school and beat that bell.
_______________ and ring, ding, dong.
We ______________ rap about this song. (2)

Ha! now something got wrong. I took another turn.
I didn't want to study, didn't even want to learn.
Didn't want to go to class. I was always late because school became something that I started to hate.
Started hanging with my boys; didn't mean no harm. we was going around the school pulling fire alarms.
I was a chilly homeboy, yes, I was down because I came to school just to mess around.
I started hanging in the halls, writing on the walls, until I got started playing basketball.
But I didn't have a job so I couldn't get paid and I couldn't play ball because of my grades.
But I still used to practice each and every day in case the coach decided to let me play.
But it didn't work out the way I planned, so I ran to a man who said he can understand the troubles I was going through.
He said, son it's all about going to school.

S c h o o l, you got to go to school and beat that bell.

E-mail, what goes here? ____________
I'm feeling cool 'cause I was going on to something they call high school.
And I feel important, 'cause things aren't the same, wondering why nobody knows my name.
That became something that I started to miss, and now that I'm here it feels like a big dis.
But, anyway, I had to leave. I had something to achieve.
It was singing- yeah- that's what I wanted to do, so I got a tutor, because I'm no fool.
Dropping out of school is quite absurd, and it's something new edition just spread the word.
Stay in school!

I can see you in the morning when you go to school
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule,
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work
And be like Johnnie-too-good, well don't you know he never shirks
He's coming along..

After school is over you're playing in the park
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them, won't you let it work it out
And you're full of doubt

Don't do this and don't do that
What are they trying to do?
Make a good boy of you
Do they know where it's at?
Don't criticize, they're old and wise
Do as they tell you to
Don't want the devil to
Come out and put your eyes

Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you want to be that
Want to see that
Want to see that way
You're coming along

School's Out
Makin all that noise
Cause they found new toys
Well we can't salute ya

I am waiting for a man
To collect me from the station
He will drive me past your house
And the bridge and the precinct

Later on he'll stuff my mouth
With flies, sit astride me
I am waiting for a man
To collect me from the station

And the kids around the flats
The mums and dads, your uncle
And I'm never going back
To your old school

Some blank verse from Michael Ray
Blue and white power on his fifteenth
Join the army or the National Front
When you're sixteen

Mickey says you were undressed
Easily led in the back field
Maybe I could come around
Your brother's out, cop a feel

And the kids around the flats
The mums and dads, your uncle
And I'm never going back
To your old school, school

I am standing in the front room
With your mother and your father
I am talking to a man
Who says he baptized you

On the way back from the church
Your brother got home early
I am waiting for a man
To collect me from the station

Does the aerosol on brick
Just make you think you still rule?
And I'm never going back
To your old school

And the kids around the flats
The mums and the dads, your uncle
And I'm never going back
To your old school, to your old school

Well we got no choice, all the girls and boys
Making all that noise 'cause they found new toys
Well we can't salute ya, can't find a plan
If that don't suit ya, that's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils, no more books
No more teachers' dirty looks

Well we got no plans and we got no principal
And we've got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever (clap)
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils, no more books
No more teachers' dirty looks

Out for summer, out till fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely

Take a look around tell me what you can see
I guess that all depends on exactly what you want it to be
Don't know all the answers everybody's running away, hey
If you want to win the game then you know it's a shame not to play
Everybody get carried away
And everybody's got something to say
To remind you
Keep looking behind you
It's never easy to see
What it takes to believe right from wrong
Never going back where I've gone

Walk on
Walk on
Walk on
Walk on
Hey alright, we're not gonna turn back now
Walk on
Walk on
Just walk on

I called you after midnight
Then ran until I burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door
We walked around the lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again

Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
And both play dead then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look
Like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything

I called you after midnight
Then ran until my heart burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look
Like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything

Take me for a walk
Take me for a walk
Let's go for a walk
Take me for a walk

Take a look around tell me what you can see
I guess that all depends on exactly what you want it to be
Don't know all the answers everybody's running away, hey
If you want to win the game then you know it's a shame not to play
Everybody get carried away
And everybody's got something to say
to remind you
Keep looking behind you
It's never easy to see
What it takes to believe right from wrong
Never going back where I've gone

Walk On
Walk On
Walk On
Walk On
Hey alright, we're not gonna turn back now
Walk On
Walk On
Just Walk On

Take a look around
And tell me what you can see
I guess that all depends on
Exactly what you want it to be

Don't know all the answers
Everybody's running away, hey
If you want to win the game
Then you know it's a shame not to play

Everybody gets carried away
And everybody's got
Something to say to remind you
Keep looking behind you

It's never easy to see
What's it takes to believe
Right from wrong?
Never going back where I've gone

Walk on, walk on
Walk on, yeah, yeah
Walk on, yeah, yeah
Walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk on, just walk on, yes

Take a look around and tell me what you see
I guess that all depend on exaclty what you want it to be
Is your cup half-full? is your cup half-empty?>br> how can you get what you need in the land of plenty?
Everybody gets carried away
Everybody's trying everyday to remind you
(ooo) leave it behind you
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong?
Never knowing where you belong
Walk on
Walk on

Sometimes I feel like I'm just doing time
Everybody wonders where you're going when you step out of line
Don't know all the answers, someone's got to stand up and say "hey!"
If you want to win the game then you know you're gonna have to play

Everybody's got to find a way
And everybody's trying everyday to remind you
What's standing behind you?
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong
Never knowing where you belong
Walk on
Walk on
Walk on
There's no turning back
Walk on
Get your train on the track

Some find their solace in a bottle of gin
Some find it still better when their horse comes in
It's a way to deal when life ain't grand
You just a pack it up, hang your head and fold your hands

She worked all day long on a street named Despair
In a town with no pity, she was going nowhere
Well, funny how her heart, well, it grew colder and colder
With the weight of the world crashing down on her shoulder

But when the going gets tough
And the tough are long gone, just to

Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can take your words made of psycho babble
I don't need no shrink to see my life's unraveled
Pay you a mountain of gold to candy coat my lies
I'm at the end of my rope, time I realize

That when the going gets tough
And the tough are long gone, just to
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on

Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Well, I know we ain't seeing the best of times
And I long stopped dreaming those crazy dreams of mine
These days get so long and my heart grows weak
And honey, we ain't living on no easy street

But when the going gets tough
And the tough are long gone
It's just you and me, baby, left to walk on

Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah

Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah

Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on

Well deep in the woods
Where nothing is seen
A tightrope is strung to his heel
And high on the walk
He's down on one knee
He waits for the slow of the breeze
Oh, wow, look at him now on his feet
High up in the sky

And every moment extends endlessly
It feels as though time isn't moving
And every second, one breath not to breathe
I watch as he moves to the beat

Well I'm on the floor
I watch from my seat
I watch as he sways with the trees
And slowly he moves, but so elegantly
I'm more on the edge of my seat

On the tightrope
Everything's bare
All that there is is from here to there
On the tightrope
The goal is quite clear
Don't lose yourself in your fear

Everyone waits on the walk
Some are long and some small
But all of them tall
Everyone must make a choice
Will I go for it all and possibly fall?
The tightrope is thin
I could possibly win on the walk

Well high on the walk
The tightrope it bends
And nobody knows where it ends
To win or to lose
You're all on your own
Everyone must be alone

On the tightrope
Everything's bare
All that there is is from here to there
On the tightrope
The goal is quite clear
Don't lose yourself in your fear

Someone called out to you
And it sounded just like crying
On a street where nobody
Even knows your name
Your mind was getting high on the sweet air
As your spirit was flying

Steam rising from the sidewalks
Of New Orleans after an evening rain
Steam rising from the sidewalks
After an evening rain

And it only made the heat
Feel like it was walking even closer
As you headed up St. Charles
To catch a streetcar named Desire
Young couple struggling in the doorway
Like he was trying to force her

In the distance you swore
You could hear them open fire
Tires squealing in the distance
As you heard them open fire

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
Don't look back
Don't ask questions
Don't you try to understand
Walk on, walk on
Straight back down to your hotel room
Where she lies waiting for her man

You're so afraid you might be losing love
That is makes you worry
And you wonder if she's ever seen this
Kind of fear in you
And you think of that young couple
In the doorway
And it makes you hurry

You wonder what kind of fear
They might be living through
Yeah you wonder if
They saw that fear in you

[Chorus]

Well I know you heard of the Susie Q
And I know you heard of the Chicken too
And I know you heard of the Cha-Cha too
But the walk is a dance that you can do

You just walk
You just walk
Oh you walk
Yes you walk
Yeah you walk
And that's the walk

Well I know you heard of the Texas Hop
And I know you heard of the old Fox Trot
But when you do the walk, you ride in style
You just shake your hips and close your eyes

Then you walk
Yeah you walk
Then you walk
Yes you walk
Ah you walk
Yes you walk
Do the walk

Do the walk
Yeah you walk
Come on walk
You do the walk
Yeah you walk
That's the walk

Well I know you heard of the old Mambo
And I know you heard of the old Congo
But when you do the walk, you standing close
And don't you step on your partner's toes

You better walk
Yeah you walk
Ow you walk
Yes you walk
Ah you walk
That's the walk

Now if you don't know what it's all about
Come to me and I'll show you how
We'll do it fast, we'll do it slow
Doin' all the walk everywhere you go

Then you walk
And you walk
Now you walk
Keep on walkin'
Keep on walkin'
That's the walk
That's the walk
Yeah the walk
Oh baby the walk
Yeah you gotta walk
Don't you know you wanna walk

I saw, a glimpse, a shimmer, a shadow
Of something, I had once but since lost
And now I, I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore

Don't even tell me where, we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where, we are going
Just walk, just walk, by my side

It starts with a glimpse
A shimmer, a shadow
Of something, I had once but since lost
And now I, I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore

The salt in my eyes, as I clear the border
Imagining lines, shatter and shimmer
I get to you, to ask you a question
I get to you, to find out for certain
Are you fixin'?
Don't even tell me where, we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where, we are going
Just walk, just walk, by my side

Don't even tell me where, we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where, we are going
Just walk, just walk, by my side
Just walk, by my side

Are you fixin', to come with me?
Are you fixin', to fix me, fix me?

Don't even tell me where, we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where, we are going
Just walk, just walk, by my side

Don't even tell me where, we are going
Hands over my eyes, hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where, we are going
Just walk, just walk, just walk, just walk, by my side
Just walk, by my side

I'm coming down with a heartache tonight
Only you can make it all right
If I can be with you holding you tight
There won't be no more in my life

Every where I turn
I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile
Angels cry
Every time you walk on by

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by

(Every time you walk on by)

I keep my cool I pretend I'm not here
Every time you come too near
I'm such a fool 'cause, this love is true and
If I don't tell you someone else surely will

Every where I turn
I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile
Angels cry
Every time you walk on by

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by

(Feeling lonely)

If I ever see you again
This craziness must find an end
I look at you
I promise myself

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by

Every time you walk on by

I remember how rough your hand felt on mine
On my wedding day
And the tears cried on my shoulder
I couldn't turn away
Well so much has happened to me
That I don't understand
All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach
Tracing your footprints in the sand
Trying to walk like a man

By Our Lady of the Roses
We lived in the shadow of the elms
I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church
Whenever she heard those wedding bells
Well would they ever look so happy again
The handsome groom and his bride
As they stepped into that long black limousine
For their mystery ride
Well tonight you step away from me
And alone at the altar I stand
And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray
For the strength to walk like a man

Well now the years have gone and I've grown
From that seed you've sown
But I didn't think there'd be so many steps
I'd have to learn on my own
Well I was young and I didn't know what to do
When I saw your best steps stolen away from you
Now I'll do what I can
I'll walk like a man
And I'll keep on walkin'

The wind blows hard
The climb is slow
Shadows are dark
I stumble on these stones
But my Lord, You are near
I will not fear

I chose to take this road called faith
I will walk on
I trust that You will lead me through
I will walk on

No end in view
At times I feel alone and the signs are few
But at least they all say home
And You my Lord, You're the hope I hold
Strength of my soul

I chose to take this road called faith
I will walk on
I trust that You will lead me through
I will walk on

Because of love
There was an awful hill You climbed
And because of love
I'll live my faith
One step at a time
The course is set
Life's hard but yet
We will walk on
Around each bend, until the end
We will walk on

We chose to take this road called faith
We will walk on
We trust that You will lead me through
We will walk on
We Will Walk On
We Will Walk On

I chose to take this road called faith
I will walk on
I trust that You will lead me through
I will walk on

Easy now, with my heart
Easy now, oh with my heart
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
You walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
Careful now, ooh with my head
I said careful now, what you do to my head
Well make your mind up, make your little mind up
To reach is oh, to reach is to oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up

In my bed, I'm rolling over
I'm tangling up in chains on the swings on the set on the night that we met
And now the beads of water, move up the glass
You speak your mind, and you can not take it back
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
It's, it's burning up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.

Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

I'm going for a walk
Not the after dinner kind
I'm gonna use my hands
And I'm gonna use my mind

And who the hell are you to tell me what to do?
You can't even tie your own haggard shoes
Your closet is a mess, and your backyard's falling down
And I have no grand ideas or intentions of sticking around

I'm gonna build a world
Independent and exempt
All alone I'll be an empire
With no mortgage and no rent

And I don't need to live in your stinking zoo
You can't even feed the animals donated to you
Your storage sheds are ramshackled, flies decorate the walls
And you expect me to die here in this shit-filled tiny stall?

And I know you're watching! everything I do
Call me threat to your children call me socially unglued
Call me master of insanity, unable to relate
Call me lazy, bane, and filthy
Call me monstrous reprobate

I'm going for a walk and there's nothing you can do
'Cause I don't have to live like you
So I'm going for a walk

Oh ain't life wonderful
When everything is right
But sometimes wonderful
Can fall apart sometimes
When your troubles knock you down
Pick yourself up off the ground and

[Chorus]
Walk on
Walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on
Oh walk on
Don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light till you find the sun
And you'll be better off in the long run
And walk on

Oh it's a heartache when love comes to an end
But even though your heart breaks
You know it's gonna mend
Keep the faith right through goodbye
And don't you ever break your stride


Walk on
Walk on
Oh walk on
Walk on
Oh walk on

Walk on
If you should meet
Walk on
On down the street
Walk on
Don't even look
Walk on
Close up the book
We don't walk the world to see us
Like we are
We should never have even gone this far
Quickly brush away that teardrop
Walk away darling
Don't stop
Don't look back for me baby
Walk on
Walk on
Don't turn around
Walk on
To higher ground
Take the world we shared together
Keep it in your heart forever
Don't forget me
Oh baby walk on
If you ever love me baby
Walk on

I love it all
These games we play
I close my eyes
You run away

I'm sure I asked you to stay
But now you're gone
And so I feel the grey
Pulse in my head

I turn off the lights and crawl into bed
I try to think of sunshine
But my body goes wet
With the first crash of thunder

I don't think I can know
Anyone but you dear
That's for sure

When it gets to four
It's my turn to go
Oh the kiss
So alcoholic and slow

Arranging me for Saturday
I thought you would know
That I always sleep
Alone

I don't think I can know
Anyone but you
Dear
That's for sure

The upstairs room is cool and bright
We can go up there in summer
And dance all night

Your sister started talking at a minute after ten
So everyone jumped up
And then fell over again
In April you can join them
And stare at me

You're too far away
Too far away to touch
And this mother's love inside me
Hurts too much

Prettily waving
Playing on the sand
Dreaming of everything
Dancing

Dancing in our hands
Dancing
Dancing

Dizzy dizzy dizzy
As I speak
Like a tumbling cat
I watch in fascination

Like a vampire bat
Don't do it don't do it
Don't do it don't do it
Don't give it away

We'll use it up tomorrow
If we don't use it today

Rest your head
Oh just put it outside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night

The dream
The time love died

We pushed it in our mouths
Pushed it deep inside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night

The dream
The time
Love died

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until' your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
Until your heart

You call me on the phone, you left me all alone
All I get from you is shellshock
Another day goes by and all I do is cry
All I get from you is shellshock

I'd tell the world and save my soul
Rain falls down and I feel cold
A cold that sleeps within my heart
It tears the earth and sun apart

That's the way, I can win
A victim of your evil sin
You've lost the hold you've had on me
By causing the changes that you never see

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
Hold on, until your heart

When we walk through open doorways
Counting time in one or more ways
We can't find our peace of mind
And life becomes a life of crime

That's the day I call your name
I came to you, I called in vain
You lost the faith within your heart
The fire in your soul from the end to the start

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until' your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until' your heart stops beating
Hold on, until your heart, until your heart

I've been good and I've been bad
But common sense I've never had
No matter how I try and try
I hide the truth behind a lie

That's the way that I can win
A victim of your evil sin
You lost the faith within your heart
The fire in your soul from the end to the start

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until' your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

Hold on, it's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

You can walk or you can run
You don't have to be someone
I went on a summer cruise
Upon an ocean born to lose

My brother said that he was dead
I saw his face and shook my head
Can you see where we can't be
We're losing our blood in the sea

'Cause it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's holding our salvation
Yes, it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's holding our salvation

Oh, the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
Is causing deprivation
Oh, the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
Is causing deprivation

From my home I traveled far
I drove in my stolen car
When it broke down, I kissed the ground
'Cause I don't kiss when you're around

I don't find that I have been
The portrait of an only son
If that's the case, then who could tell
Where my story had begun?

'Cause it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's holding our salvation
Yes, it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's holding our salvation

Yes, it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's causing deprivation
Oh, the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's causing deprivation

State of the nation
State of the nation
State of the nation

Even now, I'm all alone
Behind a wall that's made of stone
I think about where we have been
And all the sights that could be seen

I know it all could be worthwhile
If only I could force a smile
Now we turn our backs to the sea
The shame of the nation we'll never be

'Cause it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's holding our salvation
Yes, it's the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
That's holding our salvation

Oh, the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
Is causing deprivation
Yes, the state of the nation
(State of the nation)
Is causing deprivation

Answer me
Why won't you answer me?
I can't recall the day
That I last heard from you

Well you don't get a town like this for nothing
So here's what you've got to do
You work your way to the top of the world
Then you break your life in two

Well what's the use in complaining
When you've got what you don't need
Anyone would think you were hard done to
What do you want me to believe?

What the hell is happening
I can't think of everything
I don't know what day it is
Or who I'm talking to

But I know that I'm okay
'Cause you're here with me today
I haven't got a single problem
Now that I'm with you

So what's the use in complaining
When you've got everything you need
Anyone would think you were hard done to
What do you want me to believe?

Express yourself
Create the space
You know you can win
Don't give up the chase
Beat the man
Take him on
You never give up
It's one on one

Express yourself
It's one on one
Express yourself
It's one on one
Express yourself
You can't be wrong
When something's good
It's never gone

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

Now is the time
Let everyone see
You never give up
That's how it should be
Don't get caught
Make your own play

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

You've got to hold and give
But do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast
But you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you
Defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them
Get round the back

Catch me if you can
'cause' I'm the England man
And what you're lookin' at
Is the master plan
We ain't no hooligans
This ain't a football song
Three lions on my chest
I know we can't go wrong

We're playing for England
(In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England
(In-ger-land)

What does this ship bring to me
Far across the restless sea
Waiting for the sirens call
I've never seen it here before

There she ? the lonely trail
Getting through the breaking winds
Drifting slowly from the coast
She is lost forever more

We all want some kind of love
But sometimes it's not enough
To the wall and through the door
With a stranger on the shore

I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all the way

I've got it all
Cause you were not the one
I don't know where to turn when you're gone
When you're gone

Gotta catch the midnight train
First to Paris then to Spain
Travel with a document
All across the continent

City life is flying by
The wheels are turning all around
Get on board we can't be late
Our destination cannot wait

All the stars and all the worlds
Filling up this universe
Can never be as close as us
We never shine as bright or??

I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all the way

I've got it all
Cause you were not the wrong one
I don't know where to turn when you're gone
When you're gone

I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all the way

I've got it all
Cause you were not the one
I don't know where to turn when you're gone
When you're gone

How many times must I lose my way, hey
How many words do I have to say, hey
What can I do just to make you see
That you're so good for a man like
A man like me

When Randolph pulls a randomizer
on his bloodline blues
to further his estate
he means to use it
'cos he's been turning weightless
since he's paid his breadline dues
he bought that token
and now needs to lose it.

This winter it's the split-eyed look
and in the squint of spring
the vogue will be
for chic polarization
kids spending their allowance
on next season's thing
because the day-glo packs
such sweet persuasion.

Rumours on the rebound
you can pick up on the news
Item equals totem claims-researcher.

In his thread-bare outfit
tearing through the parking-lot
dodging his limbs
that kick like ancient cannon
toting hardware
just to shoot his way out of this plot
that holds him to the wheels
that Adam ran on. . .

They say you must assemble
your ensemble by detail
or else end up as destitute as Randolph.

Watch her go and dance across the room
Only she knows what she's going through
In her eyes, there's a pain you can't deny
But she moves on, dance across the room, yeah

She loves when it starts to rain
'Cause it's quiet outside, and that's when she feels safe
And she dreams that love will take her away, in her mind
In her mind is her favorite place

The little moments make it worth,
Everything you go through at your worst
It's beautiful how we all heal when it hurts
Don't ever stop, fighting for what sets your heart free

I love you, more than you'll ever know
From your beautiful eyes down to your nervous bones
And my heart stops when I see you glow
And it's all that I need, it's all I know

The little moments make it worth,
Everything you go through at your worst
It's beautiful how we all heal when it hurts
Don't ever stop, fighting for what sets your heart free

The little moments make it worth,
Everything you go through at your worst
It's beautiful how we all heal when it hurts
Don't ever stop, fighting for what sets your heart free

Breath away,
Oh, you took my breath away.
And I don't, quite know, if I want it back.
Take me for.
Oh, what do you take me for? Uh.
A fool, it's true, don't know how to act, 'round you. Uh!

Dance around the room, you're the rhythm I'm the blues.
Don't know what to say, try it any way.
Nothing to lose.
Here goes nothing.

Ohh, girl I got it bad for you.
Anything you want me to, I will do, oo-oo-ooo.
So, go ahead and say the word,
The sweetest thing I've ever heard.
Got it bad for you, oo-oo-oo.

Everything.
Oh, I'd give you everything.
And more, it's yours, if you say you're mine.
Let you down.
I won't ever let you down.
You're safe, heartbreak, will never cross your mind, oh.

Dance around the room, you're the rhythm I'm the blues.
Don't know what to say, try it any way.
Nothing to lose.
Here goes nothing.

Ohh, girl I got it bad for you.
Anything you want me to, I will do, oo-oo-ooo.
So, go ahead and say the word,
The sweetest thing I've ever heard.
Got it bad for you, oo-oo-oo

Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, ooooo.
I don't want to come off too strong.
But you-oo-oo-oo-oo, took my breath away.
Oh, you took my breath away.
Oohhh!

Ohh, girl I got it bad for you.
Anything you want me to, I will do, oo-oo-ooo.
So, go ahead and say the word,
The sweetest thing I've ever heard.
Got it bad for you, oo-oo-oo

Turning all the lights off.
Walking on the sidewalk.
Even though all the stores have closed the doors, we're still up.

Come a little closer.
Walk a little slower.
We can take our time, don't let tonight be over.

Love may not be what you plan and
Things happen you don't understand.
It's a crazy life to live,
But through it all
I think we're lucky, maybe we're lucky,
Maybe we shouldn't let this moment pass us by, oh.

Waking up to sunlight.
Staying on our own time.
Even though everyone is in a rush, it feels right.

Come and lay beside me.
Listen to my heartbeat.
We can stay right here and disappear, don't worry.

Love may not be what you plan and
Things happen you don't understand.
It's a crazy life to live,
But through it all
I think we're lucky, maybe we're lucky,
Maybe we shouldn't let this moment pass us by.

I think we're lucky, maybe we're lucky,
Maybe we shouldn't let this moment pass us by, oh.

Love may not what you plan and
Things happen you don't understand.
It's a crazy life to live,
But through it all
I think we're lucky, maybe we're lucky,
Maybe we shouldn't let this moment pass us by.

I think we're lucky, maybe we're lucky,
Maybe we shouldn't let this moment pass us by.
I think we're lucky, maybe we're lucky,
Maybe we shouldn't let this moment pass us by.

You solved for me, my mystery
When there was so much that I didn't know
It's hard to see, that missing piece
Now you're mine, I never wanna let you go

You're too good to be true, I was lost until I found you
Searching for something that's worth it
Finally the wait is over, a weight lifted off my shoulders
That's why you're better than perfect

I can't deny, one look in your eyes
And I know that anything for us is possible
Without your heart, I fall apart
Together, we can be unstoppable

You're too good to be true, I was lost until I found you
Searching for something that's worth it
Finally the wait is over, a weight lifted off my shoulders
That's why you're better than perfect

I just wanna let you know tonight, I would never let you go tonight
Ohhhh, you do everything to make it right, you're better than perfect

Magic man said
"You know my dear
You are living inside a dream
Believing the things I do
Are what they seem
Life is a trick that runs too quick
For a volunteer from the crowd
The volunteers only see
What's been allowed"
The players practice to deceive
With paper flowers none perceive
Disappearing down the top hat corridors
Art and illusion
The magic show won't let you go
Magicians rehearse
Their sleights of hand
They slip money bags up their sleeves
They saw you in half
And then they turn to leave
Tricks of the trade
The ball games played
By the jugglers centre stage
Carefully handed down from age to age
Conclusions made conclusions leapt
Impressions lost and overstepped
Shadows hide the truth
With nobody the wiser

[Chorus]
They're only trying to tell your lies
Trying to make you compromise
To leave reality completely up to them

[Chorus]

How can we fight the diseases of the poor
When colour of a nation is reasoning for war
Men force your surrender, then ask you to believe
With the lives of many millions embroidered of their sleeves
Is this reason - a price to pay?
Give us reason - a first new day
Acid emotion - child of suicide
Bewilderment and hunger are hurting you inside
While hopes find protection in the sanctuary of live
Another voice is silenced in the quite of the night
Is this reason - a price to pay?
Give us reason - a first new day
All breathe together, suffocate the fear
Let each of us in comfort share the pain, the tears, the years
Don't let their hate be the dowry of a youth
Too humble for importance -
Too honest for the truth
Is this reason - a price to pay?
Give us reason - a first new day
Give us reason - a first new day

Dictate, Don't speculate, --Don't be a failure
Parasite,--Know, sense, think, read and write
Translating black and white, Hungry for logic...
Stand fast--

In a moment realize
We are thinking today
Take a look, take a look
Take control of yourself
For a moment realize
We are thinking today
Today, today,--take a look!
Doters of the silicon
Enslaved by self-design
Dependant on the life-blood

Each cry for understanding

From cradle to grave
Null and void emotion
Break free of this system
Opening eyes finding release
Each breath of inspiration
Begins and ends at the grave--
From cradle to grave
I'll find a key to lock the door
I won't let on that I'm afraid
Heaven,--Heaven I'm scared!

I'm alive--
I breathe, I feel inside
Not just a toy
Not a fault you can override
I want to be alone
If I could find a place to hide
Will you always be there
In every thought, every word
Oh you're so damn--
Clinical, useful and practical
Always fanatical,--controlled existence
Oh we may generate, design and integrate

The tighter the turn
The harder the means of escape
The deeper the nail
The stronger the coffin we make
You're free--glory
Hope you'll find silence
The biggest attraction
The hardest the habit to break
The sharper the needle
The lesser the mark that we make
In my heart is something
More precious than gold
You know something
I love you--
Take it all
Young hearts in pain
Look to the rain--
So lonely--
Nothing to say
Cloudy and grey
The louder the brave
The darker the secrets they fear
The weaker the mind
The stronger the voice will appear
Oh you'll get over glory
Song of joy today is gold
All this time what have we solved
Circle on circle of
Young hearts in pain
Look to the rain--
So lonely--
Nothing to say
Cloudy and grey
Sleep tight
Tired of learning--
How are you?
Sleep tight
Tired of learning--
How are you?
There may be times
I dream away
Young hearts in pain
Look to the rain--
So lonely--
Nothing to say
Cloudy and grey
So lonely--
Young hearts in pain
Who's going to take your nightmares away
They're going to take you for one last song
So lonely--

To bleed you dry

Masterdom
Hooked and feint - Heaven sent

In the hut
In there
In the hut, the hut
Heil!
Fascist cross the borderline
Exit crime
Invade the peace, disturb the beast
Terrify -
Clicking black, shiny box
Crack the shell!

Gold for pearl

No more room -
In the hut
In there
No more room -
In the hut, the hut
Heil!
Hooked and Feint, - Heaven sent
Martyrdom
Blondon Fair, without a care
Exodus

Listen to my tale of woe,
It's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all-alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh lady be good to me.

Purify

Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost white
Ultra clean
Want to be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything

I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I ain't dancing with what might have been

Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I...Can't you help me?
Pure if I...Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify
You and I, Purify
C'mon, Purify!

Spacial awareness
So much confusion
And it's so difficult to harness
But then I look at you, nimble and righteous

My kiss, can you feel it yet? In the back of your legs?
And on the nape of your neck?

Are you a temple? Are you a temptress?
There's too much choice, the possibilities are endless
So wash away my sins, give me catharsis!
Re-magnetize my moral compass

My kiss, can you feel it yet? In the back of your legs?
And on the nape of your neck?

Your touch, I cannot regret!
I love the shape of your mouth and the back of your head

You're so my kind
Erotic and divine
I gotta testify to how you purify

To me you're more than a human
You're more complex
You're like a fallen angel
Who uses god as a hex

My kiss, can you feel it yet? In the back of your legs?
And on the nape of your neck?

Your touch, I cannot regret!
I love the shape of your mouth and the back of your head.

You're so my kind
Erotic and divine
I gotta testify to how you purify

I cannot fight against myself
No more
Self destruction that I predicted
Not a long time ago

Petrified

Thoughts so far from me

The power of my justice blows me away
It's just the case to repeat
What I've never said to you before

Celebrate
I'm alive again

You don't expect from me
This chain reaction
You can't imagine from me
This great affection

See the structure of my pride
Wasn't easy to build it away from this
I never walked away from you
I never walked alone

A pleasure makes me vibe again tonight
I'm just thinking how fine it is to feel myself so fine again

Celebrate
I'm alive again

It's time to turn the page and start
And then
Don't you think that it's time
To convince yourself it's over?

Celebrate
I'm alive again

Given everything that innocence has pulled us both apart
Find ammunity, a part of you to fill this empty heart
Never knowing what to say, what to do, where to go
As the moment slips away, take a breath and swallow

call me hear me,
I'm cut & torn, torn
Just show me the way through
Call me hear me
I step in stone
Stone...
I'm trying to reach you
I'm trying to reach you
I'm trying to reach you

come together fell the pressure hold on tight you never know
Push the button, ease the tension, purify but take it slow
Never knowing what to say, what to do, where to go
As the moment slips away take a breath and swallow

call me hear me,
I'm cut & torn, torn
Just show me the way through
Call me hear me
I step in stone
Stone...
I'm trying to reach you

call me hear me,
I'm cut & torn, torn
Just show me the way through
Call me hear me
I step in stone
Stone...
I'm trying to reach you
I'm trying to reach you
I'm trying to reach you
I'm trying to reach you
I'm trying to reach you

I kiss my window facing south
Where endless rains are splashing blue
My mouth spills an ocean of words
Crashing waves of intention

If I stood still
Under dark gray skies
Would memories flood me
With alibis

It's here where I stand
With time in hand
Prophesize those days
Rain on me

Wash the rain away my dear

Incandescence can dance
Through white shades of sand
Perfects skies
Tell the tides
Rain on me

A thousand days of rain

And I see the sunrise kissing my face
Sometimes
And I know the sun shines down on me

Rain on me

Feel the sunlight in my face
See the sunshine in my grace
Now that I know I am here
Wash the rain away my dear

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

Listen, your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Honey, yeah

You left the water running when you left me here behind
You left the water running, running from these eyes of mine

You turned out the light of love
You left with another guy
You turned off all your love for me
But you forgot to turn off the cry
You forgot to turn off the cry

You pulled the shades away down low
And disconnected the telephone
But these tears a running from my eyes
I can't turn them off and on
No, I can't turn them off and on

You left the water running when you left me here behind
You left the water running, running from these eyes of mine

You locked the door and left me outside
And then you threw the key away
But baby, you'll regret, baby you'll be upset
When you get your water bill to pay
When you get your water bill to pay

You left the water running when you left me here behind
You left the water running, running from these eyes of mine





Baby I found a way to stop all this fussin', yeah
It's just not right darling
The way that we fight
Girl, if you would listen to what we have to say
We could stop all this fussin'
And we could do it this way
We could let love come between us
And let love bring us together
And let love be born today
And let love, let love live forever

I don't believe that you realize
How much I need you darling
And the way my heart cries
It's so hard for us to get alone
And if you'd only listen to the words of our song
And let love come between us
And let love bring us together
And let love be born today
And let love, let love live forever

It's like your baptizing me with you love

Easy like Sunday mornin', like an angel callin'
He's taking me all in,
I'm embracing him with my skin
 Like a glimmer of life, like a vision of light
And he's so perfect that I couldn't picture him if I tried

See, some may come, some may go
But I'll follow you wherever, your the perfect mate for my soul
And I know I lose control whenever
I'm around you cause you given me

(Your hand)
And that's more than enough
(your glance)
Is like jumpin' in the river of

Purify me, baby
And I'm takin'

Is like jumpin' in the river of

Purify me, baby
And I'm takin'

It's summertime always, like it's sunny out all day
Whenever you smile, sweeter than momma's homemade
I thought every man was made the same way
 But in a world of smoke and ashes boy, your are milk and honey

See some may come, some may go
But fill me up with your love, you're the nourishment to my soul
And I know I lose control whenever I'm around you cause you've given me

And that's more than enough

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

Listen, your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet

Darling, darling, pull the strings, let me sing you a song any day
I'm your puppet baby, you can sing for me all night long

Honey, yeah

Consumed by self loving pain, self loathing bliss
It ears away, burns you like a cancer
The feeling's inside, mask your size with your will
Now you fall from heart and soul
Break, years of frustration
All too plain to see

Ease into war
Invade with foul fingers
Lie to purify
Crushing what's not you

They say some are born with a blackened heart
Fell to the curse of a bastard life
Cursed with a bastard life
Your lust to celebrate your name
Will cause your fall
Can't change, years of frustration
All have yearned to see

The pedestal crumble
Ignored actor of aggression
Falsify to slave
Avoiding all that's true

You stand up, then you fall heartless, soulless appetite
You're crossing almost every line
Now it's time to wash away
You lost your way
You crossed the line
You crossed the line

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet

Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string, I'm your puppet

Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string, I'll do anything now

I'm a walking, talking, living, loving puppet, and I love you

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

Since it costs a lot to win, and even more to lose,

Goes to show, you don't ever know,
Watch each card you play and play it slow,
Wait until that deal come round,
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no.

I been gambling hereabouts for ten good solid years,
If I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears.

Well life is a gamble and the days they're just so many decks
Oh the hours are cards they deal and you play what you get
Oh you think of the the time that you knew you could call so you raised
Oh you think of the the time that you got out when you should have stayed

Deal hey may be the next card's an Ace
Deal you ought to go home but you know that a Flush beats a Straight
Oh you can't have a Full House the Queen has been dealt to a friend
Oh the good thing about life is they shuffle and they deal life again

Well the cards are all stacked when you're hot and the women are too
Oh it's a hard cut to take when you raised every hand but you do
Well I'm not complainin' it ain't like a Joker to cry
Oh it won't do to cheat cause you have to cash in when you die
So deal hey may be the next card's an Ace...

The wall of this world
It's falling down
And the ceiling of humanity
It hits the ground
We've lost all respect
The will to live
And our brothers and sisters
Show no will to give

Falling down
This world is falling down
We don't care for one another
And there's no one around
Falling down
This world is falling down
We gotta gotta gotta gotta
Turn this around

We think we've all got it
Figured out
Life's short, play hard
Is what its about
Wait a second
Can't we see we've been lied to
Turn around
And proclaim the truth

Story 'bout a friend of mine
Sick of trying all the time
The batlle rages in his mind

Silenced by the demon as the young man begins to weep
Losin' his life to bottled lies and begins to admit defeat
Thinkin' where did he go wrong as the demon tears out his soul
His flesh is lyin' to his heart it's saying he's got no place to go

He tried his own way again and again
Just can't win
Fighting a battle he was sure he couldn't win
Pondering his past and questioning his life
Just can't win
Losing a war he knows he just can't win

Thought about the friends he's lost along the way
Went crazy shot down dead ends and desolate streets
Givin' up was easy when there is nothin' but distrust and deceit
Always having to watch his back in fear as he's dragging his feet

Black woman on the street with attitude
Spits through her teeth and stares at you
White boy with the living blues
Spreads his hatred on a crowded tube
Some days I feel removed
But all I can do is think of you
I feel like I am being used yeh yeh

Well you bruise me and you batter me
And you make me feel the twist
I try to convince myself
That I'm strong because of this
My friends say I'm beautiful
But it's time to get real
I try to find some hatred
But I can't change the way I feel

And this murder happens all around my heals
But it ain't real you are the deal
And there's poison flowing all around my head
And here I am all alone in bed

Old queen on the ship of fools
You're worried that it might sail for you
White lies from the broken youth
Who hasn't got the nerve to counsell you
Some days I feel amused
But all I can do is think of you
I feel like I've been such a fool yeh yeh

Well you bruise me and you batter me
And you make me feel like dirt
And just for one minute
I've forgotten what I'm worth
My friends say you're beautiful
But it's time I got real
I'm staring at your picture
But I can't change the way I feel

And this murder happens all around my heals
But it ain't real you are the deal
And this poisons flowing all around my head
And here I am filled with regret

Is it not enough
To just feel the love
And give it
Why can't you give it
Is it not enough
To just feel the love
And live it
Why can't you live it
Why can't you give it
Oh why can't you give it
Why can't you give it
Oh why can't you give it
You are the deal
You are the deal
You are the deal-

Love me, love me for profit, I can make you go down
I can show you the money if you wanna go out
When you're ready, come and get me, I'm on Capitol Hill
Before I show you the money, let me spot you the bill

Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it, babe
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it, babe

No one pays attention now, they just wanna dance
You could be holdin' the future in the palm of your hands
So when you're ready, come and get me, I'm on Capitol Hill
Before I show you the money, let me spot you the bill

Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it, babe
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it, babe
Give it, babe, give it, babe
Gotta do it all the same
Give it, babe, give it, babe

All we need is clout
All we need is money
Gotta play the game
We can take it all the way

Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it, babe
Want money? I got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it, babe

Talk about love
When I'm in control
Give it, babe

You're always screaming about unity
Being open minded and honesty
What you might say will some people believe
But I really doubt your sincerity

If we really want this deal to work out,
We all got to rise above, we've got to stop
These petty arguments, don't you think it's time to cut the shit out

You're always screaming about unity
Being open minded and honesty
If we really want it, we all gotta try
Stop takin' behind eachother's backs
And spreading a bunch of lies

I ain't saying that I got a master plan
I ain't telling you to go out and hold eachother's hands
Just saying that we're tired of hearing your shit
And if you don't mean what you say then don't say it

Reach out, reach out [repeat 3 times]


Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
Ain't no big deal to say my love is real
When you reach out I'll be there

Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye
Sad time is gone, I got no tears to cry
So don't so say you don't know I'm right
When I say we'll get by

[chorus]

Nobody makes me feel the way that you do
Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you
Now ask me what is on my mind
So I can tell you true

Ain't no big thing, uh, yeah

Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out, yeah [repeat 3 times]
Oww
Ain't no big thing
Ain't no big thing

[chorus]

Got love for you so strong it's making me high
Don't know what I'll do if you won't give it a try
So now's the time to make it clear
Let me show you why

[chorus]

Aint no big deal to say I.... love you still

Ain't no big deal
Ain't no big thing
Ain't no big deal
Ain't no big thing
[repeat and fade]

The sun's shining and it's raining
No better way to describe my feel
When you left my heart was complaining
How a couple of days can act like years
I know living with me ain't easy
When I tell you how I feel
A simple phrase,
Hard to put into words

Let it grow
Let it show
Let it flow

I'm here to show you, baby,
This love is real

Wherever you go
My heart's bound to follow
Wherever you go
Then I'll be there

This being gone's
Been a tough pill to swallow
I hope you can feel me in the air
Now I don't mind a whole lot of waiting
If this is truly how you feel
I'm tired of scratching those reservations
If I just might, tonight, then all right

If it's real, then go on baby
And let's make that deal
Mmmmmm

I've given you the best I've got to offer
'cause there ain't no more in here to see
This premonition I have is awful
Thanks to the moonbeams' generosity

Now I don't mind a whole lot of waiting
If this is truly how you feel
I'm tired of scratching those reservations
If I just might, tonight, then all right

If it's real, then go on baby
If I just might, tonight, then all right
If it's real, then go on baby
Let's make that deal, mmmmmmmm
Let's make that deal

I don't like livin' in this town

I don't like the way it makes me feel

It ain't much better when I moved around

Rolling around rolling from town to town

I don't like to be ignored

I don't like it when you stare me down

My heart and soul are torn twisted thorn woven all around your crown

I don't mean to sound condescending

There's no need in me pretending

Let the deal go down

(instrumental)

Well it ain't no breaking news

No it ain't like it was

You got this thing you do

The thing you do

You know what it does

My head's been hanging down mmm

Dark clouds follow me around

Follow me down

Rolling on from town to town

Chorus x2

I don't like livin' in this town
I don't like the way it makes me feel
It ain't much better when I moved around
Rolling around rolling from town to town

I don't like to be ignored
I don't like it when you stare me down
My heart and soul are torn twisted thorn woven all around your crown

I don't mean to sound condescending
There's no need in me pretending
Let the deal go down

Well it ain't no breaking news
No it ain't like it was
You got this thing you do
The thing you do
You know what it does

My head's been hanging down mmm...
Dark clouds follow me around
Follow me down
Rolling on from town to town

I don't mean to sound condescending
There's no need in me pretending
Let the deal go down

I don't mean to sound condescending
There's no need in me pretending
Let the deal go down

Dolled up to the nines, you got the eyes locked on tall and dark
Well, he's mighty pretty but I'll bet he ain't worried a bit about your heart
He's a real Casanova but I think I know you just a little bit better than that
You need a real love that you can't get enough of not some Romeo act.

But if your looking for the real deal what are you doing looking at him
He ain't nothing but a cheap thrill, he can't love you like I will
Let go of yor heart girl, take mine and give it a whirl
If you're looking for love, you're looking at the real deal.

He's a smmoth talkin' fellow, he's gonna tell ya what your heart desires
He's a real go getter and you outta know better than to think about playing with fire
And if you ask me, honey, what you need is a good old fashioned romance
I'm thinkin' maybe that you need baby ought give me love a little chance.

If your looking for the real deal what are you doing looking at him
He ain't nothing but a cheap thrill, he can't love you like I will
Let go of your heart girl, take mine and give it a whirl
If you're looking for love, you're looking at the real deal.

If your looking for the real deal, what are you doing looking at him
He ain't nothing but a cheap thrill, he can't love you like I will
Let go of your heart girl, take mine and give it a whirl
If you're looking for love, you're looking at the real deal.
If you're looking for love, you're looking at the real deal.

You're looking at the real deal.

You don't know what's wrong, you only know it isn't right.
You don't remember for how long, but you wake in tears at night.
Big deal.
Big deal.

You spend four nights a week now looking for your inner child.
What you gonna say when you find him?
Suppose you don't like him or he doesn't like you?
Suppose once you wake him up he won't go back to bed and wants to stay up late watching TV?
But you say there must be some reason why you feel this way.
Big deal, that's the way we all feel.
Big deal, what is it you want to feel?
Big deal, that's the way we all feel.
Big deal, what is it you want to feel?

You say you want to get cured, you want to turn off your head.
Oh and you say it hurts, and you feel unsure.
First you doubt yourself and then you doubt her.
Big deal, that's the way we all feel.
Big deal, what is it you want to feel?
Big deal, that's the way I feel.
Big deal, what she think she feels?
What is it you want to feel?
I don't think you want to feel

Well he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy to ever let him get away
But girl you should know better
Then to go braggin' in my face
So forgive me for what I'm 'bout to say

Big deal
So what? Who cares?
Ya just got lucky that's all it was
Shut up
Don't want a hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what?
Big deal

He's perfect, I heard ya
The first ten times that ya told me
Yeah, yeah, it's amazin' his lovin'
I can't believe I let him go
I regret it, there I said it
Ya call yourself a friend
But ya just keep rubbin' it in

Big deal
So what? Who cares?
Ya just got lucky that's all it was
I swear if I hear another word about
Candlelight or long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what?
Big deal

Congratulations, I'm just so happy for you
I can't contain the way I feel

Big deal, big deal
So what? Who cares?

Honey in the bee hive

Hits me like a punch
Ready ready ready ready ready

Ev'ry time you shake it girl
I like it more

Out of the wringer, into the dryer
Spins the clothes higher
Squeezing out static and shocks
Little stockings tumbling 'round together
Couldn't cling forever
Now I'm missing one of my socks

Lord, where do they go?

One pile waits with their god in a box
The other pile nervously mocks heaven
Misfits lost in the dryer, take heart
Maybe there's a place up in sock heaven

Out of the wringer, into the dryer
Couldn't just retire
Had to try tempting the fates
One little band spinning 'round together
Couldn't cling forever
God, I think I'm losing my mates

Seven good years, followed by a feeling I'd hit the glass ceiling
Maybe I'd best disappear
Pick any market
Pick a straitjacket
If you can't act it
Misfit, you don't belong here

Lord, where do we go?

(chorus)
Didn't want a platform to build a new church
Didn't want a mansion in rock heaven
Didn't want more than to be understood
Maybe there's a place up in sock heaven

Lord, where do we go?

We're gathered here to ask the Lord's blessing
Maybe not his blessing
Maybe we're not asking at all
Out of the box with every good intention
Did you fail to mention
This time we were destined to crawl?
And every day that we died just a little more
I was sure you were sovereignly watching us dangle
I don't get it now
But I'll get it when
In sock heaven I see it all from your angle

(chorus)
God's got his saints up in sock heaven

You know what pop? What's that son?
Christmas just isn't gonna be the same this year.
Why is that?
'Cause Santa's got a brand new bag!
Come on jump up, ohhhh
Sock it to me Santa, you know what I like
Sock it to me Santa, just bring me a bike
Christmas just won't be a drag, Santa's got a brand new bag
Don't you dare let those children bring you down
You gotta spread those toys all over town
My stocking's all hung so you can see
Don't hang me up Santa lay some toys on me
Sock it to me Santa you know where it's at
Sock it to me Santa I want a baseball bat
Christmas just won't be a drag, cause Santa's got a brand new bag
I say come on Dancer, come on Prancer
A brand new Santa's got to be the answer
Come on Comet, and come on Cupid
Don't just stand there lookin' stupid

He's got a bright red cape and a white moustache (sock it to me Santa)
He's got lots of toys but no time for trash (sock it to me Santa)
He's dressed real warm from his head to his toes (sock it to me Santa)
He lost a little weight but his jelly still rolls (sock it to me Santa)
Sock it to me Santa, you heard what I said
Sock it to me Santa, just bring me a sled
Christmas just won't be a drag, cause Santa's got a brand new bag
Sock it to me Santa
Sock it to me Santa

You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

Take my lips, I wanna lose them
Take my arms, I never use them

Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

Someday we'll build a home on a Hilltop High
You and I, shiny and new
Cottage that two can fill
And we'll be pleased to be called
The folks who live on the Hill

Someday, we may be adding a wing or two
A thing or two
We will make changes as any family will
But we will always be called
The folks who live on the Hill

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen
And when our kids grow up and leave us
We'll sit and look at that same old view
Just we two, Darby and Joan
Who used to be Jack and Jill

The folks who like to be called
What they have always been called
The folks who live on the Hill
The folks who live on the Hill
The folks who live on the Hill
The folks who live on the Hill

Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me

I think back, your love was like a sun
Don't remember no dark days, I just remember the warm warm fun

Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
If we fools in life, oh woman a happy fool I'd rather be.

Oh baby I'll be glad to learn from you
And darlin' I know you will be glad to learn from me
And if we get down and things get sad, we can cheer up each other
And grin 'cause things just ain't that bad
If we fools in life, than a happy fool I would rather be

Day by day, just one step, one step at a time
'Cause woman you have given me so much
Just to ease this stubborn little achin' heart of mine

I don't care where they came from
And I don't care what they might say
Woman you've been lovin' in my corner, all the way
Day by day, that's the magical kind 'cause it's flowin' all of the time

Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me

I look back,
Your love was like the sun,
And I don't remember any cold days
I just remember the warm warm fun

Further on down the road, baby, you will accompany me

Oh babe, oh babe, oh darlin'
Oh babe, oh darling, oh babe

Oh babe, oh darlin', oh babe
Oh babe, oh, babe, oh darlin'

(Further on down the road)
(Further on)
(Further on down the road)

It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year
But ever and a day

The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go

But, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're
Going a long, long way

In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble,
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Oh my dear
Our love is here to stay

Hey, hey, hey
If I can only make you see
That you were only meant for me
Our love will be free
And I'll be your destiny
Your destiny, your destiny

If I can make you understand
Treat me right and love me
Then I will be your man
Your one and only man

Live by them each and every day

Raise your hand y'all if you hear me


Style is not biting style when you can't find the funk
Style is the face you make on a Michael Jordon dunk
Style ain't the jeep you bought when you know your broke ass got bills
Style is lettin' your lover drive while you talk on the phone and chill

you got it! Style
you got it! Style, maybe
you got it! Style, come on
you got it! Style

Style is a gold-tooth smile with an attitude
Style is a peaceful wild postin' the rude
Style is growing your own food
Style is a non-violent march
Style is an accurate account of what's inside every heart (Style)

Style is not a lie
Style is a man that cries
Style is the glow in a pregnant woman's eyes


you got it! Style, come on

But he gets dressed to get dressed
(It's only a hunch but I bet you a bunch)
(He wears suspenders, a belt and a vest)
[From the tip of his toes to his head]
[He looks like an unmade bed]

You've either got or you haven't got style
(If you got it, you stand out a mile)
A flower's not a flower if it's wilted
(A hat's not a hat till it's tilted)
[You either got or you haven't got class]

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
(Some other girl)
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go (We never go) out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah just take me home, oh

(Out of style) You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

Some people dress 'cause they dress when they dress
But he gets dressed to get dressed
(It's only a hunch but I bet you a bunch)
(He wears suspenders, a belt and a vest)
[From the tip of his toes to his head]
[He looks like an unmade bed]

You've either got or you haven't got style
(If you got it, you stand out a mile)
A flower's not a flower if it's wilted
(A hat's not a hat till it's tilted)
[You either got or you haven't got class]
[How it draws the applause of the masses]

(You either got, or you haven't got)
[Got or you haven't got]

You've either got or you haven't got style (got or you haven't got style)
[If you got it, it stands out a mile] (if you got it, it stands out a mile)
With mother of pearl kind of buttons
(You look like the Astors and Huttons)
[You either got or you haven't got class] (got or you haven't got class)
How it draws the applause of the masses

(You've either got, or you haven't style) [got or you haven't got style}
(Style and charm seem to go arm in ar) [seem togo arm in arm]
[A flower's not a flower] (if it's wilted)
[A hat's not a hat till it's tilted]
(You've either got or you haven't got style) [got or you haven't got style]
[If you got it, you stands out a mile] if you got it, you stand out a mile
(Got it you stand out) got it you stand out a mile

Style must not be underrated
 Style is often overlooked
 Style is never in the papers
 I read it like an open book
 Style
 If you can't see the substance
 Style shows how it's organized
 Style is looking for your money
 It's in the way you paint your eyes
 There is always a way
 A way things are done
 I've been learning my ABC's
 I know what is 10, I know what is 1 in
 Style is a naked look
 Underneath your style
 Style of a different place
 Talking through your style
 Even the way you hide it
 Reveals the thing you hide
 Your style may never cause a riot
 It's still a style to have no style
 There is always a way
 To light up
It's been a crazy year all around
 The check never came
 I can't let it cramp my
 Style is a world for sale
 You can't buy this style
 Style that you can't resist
 You won't cramp my style

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, cla**ic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
(Some other girl)
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, cla**ic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt

I just want one killer line
And I'll figure it out myself

Yeah, Holiday, Gary
I don't want why'all to compare me to niggas no more
Unless they got a case pending
Unless they poke somethin' up
Unless they keepin' it real gutter, why'know

SP I'm the closest thing to poison it is
You think you hot, I'ma boil your kid
You think you cool, I'ma throw you in the river wit some cement shoes
You could sleep with the fishes
Niggas actin' funny so I gotta keep it movin' I don't speak to the bitches
We could handle this like gangstas
Dog, I'll kidnap your little man and send you to the banker
That money get dropped off, so do he
Right off the booth of his mama' building
Feel the drama building
Told why'all niggas don't fuck wit P
I said fuck rap and a verse
I get down like the bishops, wit the way you clap at the hearse
I get it crunk wit a blunt and a package of verc
I'm in the shottie of the Cadillac
Wit niggas that'll take twenty a body, the shottie will handle that

Styles
Paniro the most, you hearin' the Ghost
Styles
Holiday shit, it's robbery shit
Nigga talkin' funny then body the kid, let's go
Styles
Mafia boss, rockin' the corpse
Styles
Pullin the three, cockin the four
Styles
We're closin' the windows and lockin' the doors
You could die today
Or you could die tomorrow, baby boy the option is yours, see'mon

I smoke weed 'cause the future is grim
I'm knockin' this ash off the dutch on the roof of your Benz
My lil man been runnin' since the shootin' begin
Why'all niggas talk about cases of Crist'
I talk about cases where niggas get life of the shit
And your girl visit two years, mom come forever
But near one of your mans ain't right wit his shit
But like corn I'ma flip, smokin' weed influenced by the fix
And old timers with the toolies by the hips
So come and creep wit me
And I ain't lyin' when I tell these motherfuckers
That I got the streets in me
One felony, wit two cases beat
So be about your business when you come and beef wit me
I got coke for sale and I got dope for sale
If you want to cop some work you oughta come and speak wit me


Why'all niggas know my name, but you don't know my style
What make it all ironic is the shit is the same
Keep a milli in the coat, puffin on the chronic
In the hood wit my niggas that's distributin' 'caine
If your man get bodied, number one rule is you body somethin' back
Then live with the pain
Young guns of this shit, so when I get hit
I'ma yell Sheek and 'Kiss let's finish the game
I got discipline and dedication
I'm the boss of the S N F, that's the Shootin Niggas Federation
Light a blunt and get cloudy wit me
Go get your gun and get rowdy wit me
It's a Holiday dog, mouth big, you could swallow the four
Don't you ask me what I'm robbing you for, what
'Cause you was talkin' big money
And I'm a little broke and I'm a firm believer in equality dog, what





of that inner realm that is part of your consciousness this
very moment."


please let me introduce you to a brand new idea
it aint like your stupid car because it dont come from korea
i wont charge you for this tip but you can take it to the bank
and when your whole life starts to turn around, you'll know who to thank

thank god for mc nine oh oh, will be the first thing you say
when you are jumping out of bed, at the start of every day
dropping on your knees while you are calling out my name
saying thank you thank you thank you
and you'll bless the day i came into your life

which up to this point had been a big fat joke
that you were playing on yourself but now its time you awoke
from this dream you've been having and confront reality
so shut your mouth for one minute and play attention to me


cuz im going to reveal the secret of my success
so now you can share in my continued happiness
you will know the blissful peace of all the masters of old
and everything you touch will turn to fourteen karat gold

it's an easy four word sentence
thats the key to all your dreams
so for now on you dont have to worry about no complex schemes
your life will be a simple game that you will always win
and for every dollar that you spend, the bank will pay back ten

and i know you are starting to say
why dont he stop beating around the bush
well i'll get there when i get there
there aint no need to push
cuz the point im trying to make contains my whole philosophy
so listen to what i tell you and repeat it after me

truth is out of style (out of style) (say what?)
truth is out of style (out of style) (say what?)
truth is out of style (out of style) (say what?)
truth is out of style (out of style) (say what?)



i hear what you're saying, mc 900ft jesus exactly how
did you come to the conclusion that truth is out of style?

well i was on my way to work one day when i spied a rocket ship
some aliens abducted me and took me on a trip
to a previous existence on another astral plane
i met a real nice lady there name shirley maclaine

the truth is not an obstacle for someone such as me, she said
because you see we all create our own reality
and if a problem should arise
the best thing you can say is
dont worry, be happy, and have a nice day

well i thanked her very kindly for the excellent advice
she said she'd bill me later at a reasonable price
then the aliens brought me back and beamed me down into this bar
but i could not go to work because bigfoot stole my car


truth is out of style (out of style)
truth is out of style (out of style)
truth is out of style (out of style)


the invisible electromagnetic energies of light. you also
control a mental power over even the gross
physical objects around you. this concept seems fantastic
yet it has been proven.

You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon!)

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!

Mike! - He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making the story - making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's picking it up! Let's go!

Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill
Eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"
Came back dropped Megadef, took em to church
I like bleach man, why you had the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody's giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard he's fuckin' with S. Dot!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!

They call him Ryu, he's sick
And he's spitting fire
And mike got him out the dryer he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak! - He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No he's living proof, got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike - Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with,
The kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying,
How did he do it?!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!

Yeah! Fort Minor
M. Shinoda - Styles of Beyond
Ryu! Takbir! Machine Shop!

Gimme one good reason now
Why I should hate your style
The way you talk
The way you stalk
Hating you ain't easy for me now
Tell me 'bout your wicked games
Why I should play with you
There is no sense
No consequence
Loving you won't be the same again
Gimme one good answer now
Why I should stay with you
But if I stay
You won't obey
Leaving you ain't easy for me now
Ask me 'bout your selfishness
Can't you get what I mean?
It is the truth
Nothing to lose
Hating you is easy for me now
And it never ever ends
Where it all begun
Why is life just a game?
A game without style
Not worth to play

Look out!
You ready for this?

Who's that comin' down the thoroughfare
The sunshine flashin' on his ring
Bowin' left and right and here and there
That's Chester, the trombone king

He gets his shirts straight from Paris
Cigarettes from the Nile
He tallks like a 'eyebrow', but he plays Chicago style

He gets his shoes made in London
And they're real crocodile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style

And he sometimes plays sweet
Hup-toodle-oodle-oodle-dee-ooo
But sweet or hot, he's always got
That real gut-bucket beat

He's got a neat Latin moustache
And the girls love his smile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
A trombone made in Newark
Played in Chicago style

Chicago style
Chicago style

He gets his neckties from Naples
And his socks from Argyle
Speaks Oxford English, but he plays Chicago style

Wears a stickpin from Rio, are you listenin'
You can see it for a mile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style

And he sometimes plays sweet
Uncle Jake's weary blues
But sweet or hot, he's always got
That real gut-bucket beat

He likes New York for the Opera
And gets two on the aisle
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
A trombone made in Newark
Played in Chicago style

Yes sir
Hey-hey
A trombone played Chicago style

Look out!
You ready for this?

You got a hot date on your arm
You got good looks and plenty charm
You got a nice ride and everything
Ain't nothing wrong with you
You got a good job respectable
You got a nice crib you got it all
You're so well dressed and well behaved
But you just don't turn me on

My girls say I'm crazy
And that I should go with you
Think you're so amazing
That's the only thing to do
They say I'll be sorry you'll regret it if you don't
They don't need to worry
I know exactly what I want

[Chorus]
I like a man with a hip-hop style
I like a man with a drop-top ride
I like a man who's independent
Uh huh huh say it again
I like a man with a hip-hop style
I like a man who can drive me wild
I like a man who can take control
Uh huh huh huh that's all

I need a rude boy with some edge
I need a ruff-neck makin' ends
I need a hot player hustlin'
Now that's what I want
I need a t-shirt with some jeans uh
That's just how it is
I need a good lover to do me right
Somebody that can turn me on

My girls say I'm crazy
And that I could go with you
Think you're so amazing
That's the only thing to do
They say I'll be sorry you'll regret it if you don't
You don't have to worry
I know exactly what I want

[Chorus]

I know just what I like
And I know when it's right
I don't need nobody else to tell me no oh
I just want to be free to be who I want to be
Can you blame me

Yo you ready for this one ladies Check it out
We like a man that is independent
Won't be asking for your pocket money or to pay rent
So stand up on your own and don't be given me no stress
Your showing me positions just to keep my interest
I like the way your lips and your hair look cris
But I'm commanding everything I'm doing in my midst
Eternally, intelligent, thats how a women is
You better pull the right strings
If you wanna get with this

[Chorus]

Shed my skin since you came in,
Where do you end and I begin?
Awoke my senses yet you stopped time,
You took me to a deeper high,
The essence of my hopes and fears,
Creation of my muddled dreams

Cowboy Style,
With a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple
Won't you stay a while

Found my voice to have my say,
You take me close to far away,
And now I find and now I feel,
The ordinary is surreal,
Peace and terror all in one,
My future life has just begun

Cowboy style,
With a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while

Won't you stay a while

I am frightened I'm aroused,
I'm enlightened to the now

Cowboy style
Cowboy style

Cowboy style,
With a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple
Won't you stay a while

Look out!
You ready for this?

He likes New York for the Opera
And gets two on the aisle
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
A trombone made in Newark
Played in Chicago style

Yes sir
Hey-hey
A trombone played Chicago style

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
My love

Here I am reaching out for ya
But there's nothing to reach for
Guess my mind don't believe what my eyes have seen
The blames you gave, you know, and I know, know
That nobody, wants your, wishy, washy ways
Your mama raised from a child
And spent no time worth while
And I feel, you really come to nothing no

You've gotta change, your style of life
You've gotta change, your style of life

Ohh, there you go, still I think I love ya
But it's a matter of time
I have told ya, and told ya how bad I wish to hold you
My feelings have doubt in mind
You know, and I know, that you can do better
Tomorrow's a brand new day
I have tried to make you change, but you remain the same
And I feel, you really come to nothing no

You've gotta change, your style of life
You've gotta change, your style of life

You and me, baby
Have been together for so long
Now you're acting like you own me
Hey baby, that's so wrong
You... hate to suffer for what you get
My love don't come easy
Why don't you change, baby please, please

You've gotta change, your style of life (u gotta change)
You've gotta change, your style of life (turn around)
You've gotta change, your style of life (mmmm)
You've gotta change, your style of life (mmmm)
You've gotta change, your style of life (mmmm)
You've gotta change, your style of life (mmmm

There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

You got a hot date on your arm
You got good looks and plenty charm
You got a nice ride and everything
Ain't nothing wrong with you
You got a good job respectable
You got a nice crib you got it all
You're so well dressed and well behaved
But you just don't turn me on

My girls say I'm crazy
And that I should go with you
Think you're so amazing
That's the only thing to do
They say I'll be sorry you'll regret it if you don't
They don't need to worry
I know exactly what I want

[Chorus]
I like a man with a hip-hop style
I like a man with a drop-top ride
I like a man who's independent
Uh huh huh say it again
I like a man with a hip-hop style
I like a man who can drive me wild
I like a man who can take control
Uh huh huh huh that's all

I need a rude boy with some edge
I need a ruffneck makin' ends
I need a hot playa hustlin'
Now that's what I want
I need a t-shirt with some jeans uh
That's just how it is
I need a good lover to do me right
Somebody that can turn me on

My girls say I'm crazy
And that I could go with you
Think you're so amazing
That's the only thing to do
They say I'll be sorry you'll regret it if you don't
You don't have to worry
I know exactly what I want

[Chorus]

I know just what I like
And I know when it's right
I don't need nobody else to tell me no oh
I just want to be freeto be who I want to be
Can you blame me

Yo you ready for this one ladies
Check it out
We like a man that is independent
Won't be asking for your pocket money or to pay rent
So stand up on your own and don't be given me no str'

Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it cuz it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet
But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet

You want it all but you can't have it

It's cryin', bleedin', lying on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame

You want it all but you can't have it

Well I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long

Where I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, I'm going out west
Out on the coast
Where the California girls
Are really the most

And I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, the girls are frisky
In old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick
Wherever you go

And I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Nights we hide between the walls and voices leading on the ground
Arms reaching out, hoping for the chance to start
Hearts holding out waiting for the bells to

Bring my words to all of you and if they ever hear my voice
Hold me in your thoughts laid out twisted in defense,
Hoping for the chance to start

Hearts holding out waiting for the bells to
Send my love to all my friends and if I never make it back
To hold you in my arms again not letting go this time

And the brightest sign, it is full of holes
And it's full of paying lost violent criminals
With a little fate
And the worst of lies, with a love so deep
Its war with endless fire inside
Go right back to the line

Every single day, every 9 to 5
Ever body works it hard, but then we finally die
And there's no remorse
Or the slightest sound
We're forever cool with the way it breaks up and down

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday

On the Sunday rain
Like a lonely ghost
And the furthest point from here is right outside the door

Open up your eyes
Take a breath if you will
And the sun is still alive even though it's hard to tell

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday
Let's start a riot

Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along

Nobody's right nobody's wrong let's start a riot

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right

Am I a barren temple left for newer ways of speaking mysteries my veils
Cannot contain?
Should I prepare to winter spans again of silent centuries pierced for only
Certain men?
What if I wake to find You've gone?
What if Your presence was withdrawn and I was mistaken all along to think I
Could become Your home?
It'd be no surprise to finally know that I am truly alone.
Come death but likely sooner I'll be alone.
You moved Your temple inside our bones and it's so hard to trust that You
Won't move again.
For all eternity You stood with Your Father in perfect unity.
And when You walked the earth, You only went where He led.
You only spoke what He said.
So for everything You left, and all of the glory You forfeit, no matter how
Low You were sent, you still couldn't know what it's like to be alone.
Disgraced but You were never alone. Betrayed but You were never alone.
Tortured but still never alone and nothing is worse than being alone.
I have been thinking hard about us trading places that maybe I could wear
Your beauty if You put on my shame.
Jesus I've been trying so hard to look like You that I almost missed the
Worst of what I put You through.
You didn't die for sins, You died covered in them, a prideful lying thief
Gasping out my final breaths.
For that one moment you looked just like me, so Your father left You and You
Died completely alone.
For me, You were alone.
He couldn't bear it so He left You all alone.
No better promise than true sympathy.
You conquered death all alone.
'Cause You've known the deepest of all our needs. Never again. Never alone.

From the underground town down the hill

Some kitty purr I call em sir too
Any trick that diss gets a curfew

You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby you're the one

I remember when
I used to be afraid to love again
But now I realize
That you're the one who brings the sun
You turn

You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby you're the one

Something real I can feel
I was searching for
I didn't wanna hurt no more
Then you came, made a change
Since you came and made it right
I can love you all my days

You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby you're the one

Can you tell me where would I be?
What would I do if I hadn't found you?
Though I've been in love before
You can be compared to none
Cuz you really bring the sun

You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby you're the one

I always try to hide the way that I feel
But I can't lie
That you're the one for me
You bring me ecstasy

You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby you're the one

Sunshine in my life
No more stormy days
Sunshine in my life
No more stormy days
Sunshine in my life
No more stormy days





Can you feel it, see it, hear it today
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

You want it all but you can't have it

It's cryin, bleedin, lying on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame

You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

Taking your time trying to find your way,
no knowledge that you've been led astray.
They're holding you down with claws of love.
Keep you from saying what you're thinking of.

What have you done?
Your life isn't for you anymore.
Where have you gone?
Your old self is easy to ignore.

You surrendered.
Just follow the path they've laid out.
You pretend to be happy.

This is not about our future,
It's about what we do now.
Nothing is more real than life,
And you have the right to be yourself in the crowd.

I will miss you.
I'm not good enough for you.
No spring in your step.
Your shining fire has been put out.

Sealed yourself in.
Nothing can affect your thick skin.
I can't get through to you,
And now you'll never learn anything new.

You look around, creativity dead.
You're missing out on the blued and red.
You're fucking blind!
Your brain has been immersed in whitewash.

It's been a long time, since you and I got together
Like old times, say the next time is way even better
We should reinvent, no wait
My casa nawl your place
And when you throw it back, I'm going to handle up
On a Tuesday we be going up
'Cause it's going down and you like it, so enticing
Got you mind gone and that body party inviting, and I'm liking
Everything I see,
No limits to your Master P and I'm bout it bout it
But I make you say, Uh
When I'm going in and in and out it
And that's real shit, flashbacks of us sweating
My body all over your body, be the answer to all these questions
I got you, cause you're into me and I'm into you
Can't say what I will and what I won't do, ain't much for words I'll rather show you so

I hope you're, ready,
For what I, got in store
Tonight's gone, be so
Epic, if you let me
It's gone be an epic night, taking advantage of you
It's gone be an epic night, got you doing things you'll say you never do
It's gone be an epic night, it's gone be an epic night
It's gone be an epic night, a night to remember

You bad as hell and you know it girl
'Cause that thang there is so potent girl
When dress it up now model in it, damn, see I need a minute
Just to admire you and your silhouette, stop, this may take a sec
Got your photograph in my memory
See the mood is right now it's time we make new memories
Straddle me like a surfboard, drunk in love now brace for it
What I got in store you can't pay for, and when you squirt you're going to want more
Another round you whispering in my ear, and I'll take you there
From the bed to the floor to the couch, as long as I get you there
You know how it goes, scratching, curled toes
It's an epic night full of role play with head board knocking and 12 play
If you like the shit then I love it
Later on you can think about it, I know fucking well you'll think about it
Let it soak in, now you're hoping that we stay the night
'Cause a nigga like me in the morning, I'm beat, beat, beat it more than twice, nice

I hope you're, ready
For what I, got in store
Tonight's gone, be so
Epic, if you let me
It's gone be an epic night, taking advantage of you
It's gone be an epic night, got you doing things you'll say you never do
It's gone be an epic night, it's gone be an epic night
It's gone be an epic night, a night to remember

It's gone be,
An epic night
It's gone be
An epic night
I'm gone give you everything you desire
Bring your love and passion baby I'm give you that fire
Enjoy yourself, I'm gone enjoy myself
Let's make it a rememberable night

I hope you're, ready
For what I, got in store
Tonight's gone, be so
Epic, if you let me
It's gone be an epic night, taking advantage of you
It's gone be an epic night, got you doing things you'll say you never do
It's gone be an epic night, it's gone be an epic night
It's gone be an epic night, a night to remember

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

[Chorus]

Two coats were before me
An old and a new
I asked my sweet master
Oh what must I do

The old coat was ugly
So tattered and torn
The other a new one
Had never been worn

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

The first man was earthy
And made from the ground
We bore all his image
The whole world around

The next was my savior
From heaven so fair
He bought me this new coat
You now see me wear

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

Now this coat it suits me
And keeps me warm
It's good in the winter
It's good in the storm

My savior has dressed me
In a garment so rare
He bought me this new coat
You now see me wear

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves,
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe.

I look to the east, I look to the west,
A youth asking fate to be rewardin'.
But fortune is a blind god, flying through the clouds,
and forgettin' me on this side of Jordan.

Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves,
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe.

Silver spoons to some mouths, golden spoons to others,
Dare a man to change the given order.
Though they smile and tell us all of us are brothers,
never was it true this side of Jordan.

Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves,
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe.

Like some ragged owlet with its wings expanded,
Nailed to some garden gate or boardin'.
Thus will I by some men all my life be branded
Never hurted none this side of Jordan.

Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves,
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe

It's a long time since I saw you last
So tell me how you've been
Did you ever get to buy that yellow coat?
Do the flowers in you window box
Still smile when you walk in?
Did you read the letters that I wrote?
And I've been on the road since Christmas
But it don't seem so long
Outside of that there isn't much to say.

I cut down on my drinkin' some
And wrote another song
I wish you wouldn't look at me that way
Remember all the mornings
We'd walk around the park
The nights we babysat for Billy's kids
And all the times we used to talk
Of having one ourselves
I don't remember why we never did
Do the neighbors still complain a bit

When the music gets too loud?
Does your old cat still sleep up on the bed?
And do you still walk around
With your head up in the clouds?
Have you heard a single thing I've said?
It's a two day drive to New York
Guess I'd better go
Have you noticed the weather's gettin' cold?

And it's a long time since I saw you last
Tell me how you've been
Did you ever get to buy that yellow coat?
Did you ever get to buy that yellow coat?

I can't be held responsible for my behavior
I lost all contact with my only savior
Please don't lock me out because I missed to phone ya
I can't bear to live forever like a loner

Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat

I seen you on a Tuesday morning
Everyone but me seems still to be yawning
I can write a letter and I'm gonna to ya
Am I gone blind thinking about you lot

Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat

I try to explain but you never understand it
I need your body but I can't just demand it

Keep singing
Don't let go of the coat
Keep telling myself now
Don't let go of the coat
That's why I'm singing now
Don't let go of the coat
Oo, Don't let go of the coat

Admitting to myself
Don't let go of the coat
Quit felling bad for myself
Don't let go of the coat
Just gotta look after myself
Don't let go of the coat
Oh, Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat
Don't let go of the coat

You were singing alone,
I called you on the telephone
The fur coat in your room roamin around like animals do
You look so nice in soft and kinds eyes

You were so nice
Won't you come alive
You were dancing along
Singing "everything" I didn't know

I want to know your name
It's not that it would matter anyway
You looked so nice in soft and kinds eyes

You were so surprised
Won't you come alive
There was nothing to do
Lay around your dusty room

She uses her toes, changing channels to the radio
You look so nice
Can I stay the night?
You were so surprised in soft and kind eyes

I remember crowds
where you stand alone right now
I remember celebrations
But now my reign has run
all the color from
all my decorations
And I'm fine; I'm just a little lonely
So can I ride on your back for a time?
Oh, the seasons change
so quickly these days
And while the rest in their new coats and new hats
shiver in their beds
You stand outside
and watch the clouds go by
in the same clothes that I met you in

I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't want to get off

If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it

Sitting here flossing
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juice flowing down your thigh

If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it

Until we reach the stream
You'll be on my jockey team, oh

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind, it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood

I'm all dressed up for the dance
I'm all alone in romance

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

[Chorus]

See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of a summer day


La la la la la la [Repeats]

It's gonna bring me down
The posh will be friendly
And I will hardly make a sound as I fall
With guilty eyes and a foolish smile
I'm increasing the gravity
It's not like getting high
Could I just keep quiet for a wonderful minute
The air is full of snow my heart with meaning
I sing along as it melts
Upon the tongue like a taste of electricity almost gone

Everything beautiful it's just a matter of distance
Between the city lights, things have a way of leaving me out
Where in the universe lies the location that I spoke so highly about
It's recommended to lie and change the subject
Every goddamn time and avoid confrontation
I may be strong but not equipped with anything more than a stranger
Would easily remove, I know!

Hunting, the quest for the kill
Taking ones life the ultimate thrill
Voracious, desire so grand
Carnage and victory go hand in hand
Fatality's increasing, countless numbers slain
Survival, afflictions and personal gain
Hostile, malicious onslaught
Compelled to slay, until death or till caught
History will always repeat
Ordained to vanquish will never complete
Fatality's increasing, countless numbers slain
Throughout our history murder has reigned

Victims at hand

Instinct to kill

Shone the rest of my days

Our own correspondent is sorry to tell
Of an uneasy time that all is not well
On the borders there's movement
In the hills there is trouble
Food is short, crime is double

Prices have risen since the government fell
Casualties increase as the enemy shell
The climate's unhealthy, flies and rats thrive
And sooner or later the end will arrive

This is your correspondent, running out of tape
Gunfire's increasing, looting, burning, rape

Then just as his brain at times of producing
High levels of tension
Shifts, to memory fragments, attempts
By means of the sense of perception

To confront these trivialities with ease

Like crossing a river by jumping its stones
Building a track, take him back to the other side

That is just when his brain perceives the increasing
Levels of tension
In the area of the sense

There where the sense of present tense
Prevails
To bring all that
That is aware
Into focus at one spot
That spot we call
Presence

Starrider, rider, rider
Show me where you are

Northern lights flashed by
And then they were gone
And as old stars would die
So the new ones were born

And ever on i sailed
Celestial ways
And in the light of my years
Shone the rest of my days

Speed increasing
All control is in the hands of those who know
Will they help us grow
To one day be starriders

Starrider, rider, rider

Starched white shirts, so neatly pressed by domestic muses
Feed delusions that everything is working out right
But your ribs can't withstand the increasing weight
As your heart gets heavier, and sooner or later
It falls to the tips of your toes

And every day tastes like inhaling
When you just lit the wrong end (that plastic burning scent)
Your only friends are on the exit ramps of gridlock caravans
You try to ask how they've been
But the metal and glass is too thick

Zoo time is she and you time
The mammals are your fav'right type
You'd better want her tonight.
Heart beat
Increasing heart beat
You hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos
Elephants and tacky tigers.
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me who's gonna leave.
Flying
Domestic flying
And when the stewlrdess is near
Do not show any fear.
Heart beat
Increasing heart beat
You are a khaki-coloured bombadier
It's Hiroshima that you're nearing.
This town ain't big enough for the both of us

Daily except for Sunday
You dawdle into the cafe
Where you meet her each day.
Heart beat
Increasing heart beat
As twenty cannibals have hold of you
They need their protein just like you do.
This town ain't big enough for the both of us

Shower
Another shower
You've got to look your best for her
And be clean ev'rywhere.
Heart beat
Increasing heart beat
The rain is pouring on the foreign town
The bullets cannot cut you down.
This town ain't big enough for the both of us

Census
The latest census
There'll be more girls who live in town
Though not enough to go round.
Heart beat
Increasing heart beat
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
I ain't gonna leave

I stole a ride on a passing star
Not knowing where I was going
How near or how far
Through years of light, lands of future and past
Until the heavenly gates
Were sighted at last

Starrider, rider, rider
Take me to the stars
Starrider, rider, rider
Show me where you are

Northern lights flashed by
And then they were gone

Shone the rest of my days

The temple of the soul
Home of the spiritual source
Blessed with powers we unfold
Human magnetism, uncontrolled

Personal energy
The magic of nature
A presence of ourselves we cannot see

Personal energy
Consciousness, life towards the essence of eternity

A domain of harmony
Captured past and future
A vision of reality
Divided structures, the higher senses, polarity around all creatures,
Increasing possibilities of self-discovery,
Energetic thoughts creating electricity

I've fallen face first into a painting
Of hallucinogenic sunset.
At vital beach, vital beach, vital beach, yeah!
Vital beach, vital beach

well I'm the boy on the beach with the guitar,
Click-click, click-click, click-click, click!
We're the band on the stage at the wedding
By the sea with frozen t-t-t-t-tidal waves.

alright, she's a concubine turned trophy wife,
He's a high profile CEO.
All the seagulls mutter,
"What'cha doing with your life?"
And vomit laugh tracks on your lead solos.

Brittle, brittle moon!
We're grieving for you
Brittle, brittle moon!
Held together with glue
And we sing,
"Everybody's waiting for you to drop!"
Then we fall face first into another painting...

I've fallen face first into a painting
Of a hallucinogenic seascape.
At vital beach, vital beach, vital beach, yeah!
Vital beach, vital beach

I'm the boy in the sharkskin tuxedo
All my fans are screaming,
"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!"
My agent said I should chew off my own face
I have no taste and anything could help

Sing it again, "Three cheers for opportunity!"
This is the year of speedboats, summer homes.
Still the seagulls mutter,
"What'cha doing with your life?"
And vomit laugh tracks on your career goals.

Brittle, brittle moon!
We're grieving for you
Brittle, brittle moon!
Held together with glue
And we sing,
"Everybody's waiting for you to drop!"
Then we fall face first into another painting...

at vital beach, vital beach, vital beach, yeah!

Unstable condition
A symptom of life
In mental
And environmental
Change

Atmospheric disturbance
The feverish flux
Of human interface
And interchange

The impulse is pure
Sometimes our circuits get shorted
By external interference

Signals get crossed
And the balance distorted
By internal incoherence

A tired mind become a shape-shifter
Everybody need a mood lifter
Everybody need reverse polarity

Everybody got mixed feelings
About the function and the form
Everybody got to deviate
From the norm

An ounce of perception
A pound of obscure
Process information
At half-speed

Pause
Rewind, replay
Warm memory chip
Random sample
Hold the one you need

Leave out the fiction
The fact is
This friction
Will only be worn by persistence

Leave out conditions
Courageous convictions
Will drag the dream into existence

A tired mind become a shape-shifter
Everybody need a soft filter
Everybody need reverse polarity

Everybody got mixed feelings
About the function and the form
Everybody got to elevate
From the norm

I have my reasons
For the vices I embrace.
Our world of treasons
And out there on the escape.

No one else here,
This conversation's been drowned here.
Sixteen is nothing,
And never will be til I'm dead.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.
(Oh, oh whoa)
Take all the hands that need you lately.
(Oh, oh whoa)
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
On you, anymore.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.

Daydream that the world stands still.
Dancing through the fibers of time.
Baby, I just want to hold
Something that was never meant to be mine.

I look to heaven to save me,
And you call me naive.
Gravity a hopeless lover
Cursed with disbelief.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.
(Oh, oh whoa)
Take all the hands that need you lately.
(Oh, oh whoa)
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
On you, anymore.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.

Dance and kill me now
To word's that I've chose
Speak only when you are spoken to.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.
(Oh, oh whoa)
Take all the hands that need you lately.
(Oh, oh whoa)
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
On you, anymore.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.
Don't' bite the hand that feeds you, baby.
(Don't bite, don't bite)
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, baby.
(Don't bite, don't bite, don't bite)
Don't fight the hands that need you, lately.

Laying you down one last time
On machines that will never give
A touch that woke you gently
I'll never know if you saw me

Did your eyes ever meet mine
We see what want to see sometime
I believe now, yes I believe

We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
You will live on in the hearts of men
Constantly
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
I will hold on until the end
There will never be an end

There are few words that are left to say
That have not already been said
Your shadows they will follow me
Long after I have confessed

Do your lips feel this kiss
Do your hands feel this touch
I miss you here
I miss you so much

We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
You will live on in the hearts of men
Constantly
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
I will hold on until the end
There will never be an end

We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
You will live on in the hearts of men
Constantly
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
I will hold on until the end
There will never be an end

This building is barely standing on it's own foundation.
I've collapsed it's lungs, calloused it's heart
And sucked the life out of this for all of Sunday to see.
I've taken the breath out of everything they believe, everything they hold true.
Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one sees my effort.
No one gets the point. Welcome to my dying home.
Welcome inside these crumbling walls.
A meaningless handshake greets them all with smiles of false hope.
Do I even care as I watch a sea of people dwindling into an audience of skin and bones
An audience who doesn't have the strength to walk out
On a man who has tarnished their faith?

Soon you'll see, as I flow fluently to frequently, another MC
Will drop off the face of this Earth - for what it's worth.
I've been the nastiest one since birth.
"New York is number one today in the house!"

[El P]
I'll do the simple shit; strike harder than Hoffa.
El the maladjusted, MC Funcrusher.
Massive; a sign for my condition, automatic.
Goldstar connect thoughts; get jostled at your position.
Listen, abort mission without further discussion.
Dual personality, half me.
Doc Jekyl when I burn your paragraph down to a haiku.
So Tootsie Roll, motherfuck, back to your seat, 'cause I don't like you.
I got a hundred beats; all nicer than your joint.
Karaoke MC's need not receive G's; that's the whole point.
Be out within' the crowd; get open like herpes simplex sores
On vexed pussy; found that I put more crush on crews than Jets.
You're just that simple, plus overfronted, but that's the status.
Cold caught my shit; you better not sit, so stop the madness.
With hip-hop guidelines, I state I never liked authority.
When sales control stats I place no faith in the majority.

[Chorus]
Auto matic, just for my people.
Auto matic, just for my crew.
Auto matic; if you're wack then you'll get.
Knocked out of the box, and you'll deserve it too.
"New York is number one today in the house!"

[El-P]
I analyze; people call me El, so, son, catch it.
MC's be disillusioned as hell; them can't hack it.
I'm a knock you out your tax bracket.
Slipped into the wrong hands; the mental barbarian
Stay-freshed in Ziplock; money plot hatcher.
How the fuck you gonna bring a Go-cart to the Grand Prix? Hee, hee.
Laughter, enter for irreconcilable disaster.
I'm a protect mine like a Japanese fighting sticks master.
Aim; pierce your vital nerve; the bloody conquest.
Rappers they be like, bro, I sunk your Battleship.
Ultra-magneto; burnin' pee burns my credo.
Mad men cry like when you realize you got a shirt full of infrared
Dots, plus I'm scopin' at this bitch; be prepared for the mental headshots.
When the CoFlow leave the room we takin' mics, bitches, and boom.
(The incredible BMS...)

[BMS]
Now the mint and governor get paid, collectin' off raids.
All the cash that was made from a brother, New York Undercover.
Don't love her; still I'm SuperHun.
Rhyme styles monstrosities; fools never stoppin' me.
I swat MC's quite easily, Dunn.
Imitate styles; most complain you can't begin to express.
Elevate off this, nine times to your brain.
Makes your mind manifest; shit's hopeless.
Stop, stop the nonsense; this could not accomplish.
Low pro interactive; go open carsnatchin'.
CoFlow, by all means necessary, packin' rhymes is automatic.
Check the barrel circumference; who done it?  Confirm it; sewers done run it.
BMS just a killer plus serial,
But still ill, and Sugarhill, to the fullest extent.
Tactic G represent, C-4 blowin' up,
Like the doors and this president.  (Dead presidents.)

[Chorus]

[El-P]
I'm gettin' fresh for my freeform .
All hold heart rocks down when I'm turnin' veterans to greenhorn.
Beat it; make a bee-line; be lax or you'll be outed.
Spit words that's really cold, pinchin' lymph nodes, El.
The inconvenience to your master plan fell; your shit's abyssmal.
Decimal point zero for the judge burnin' rhyme books.
Fuck basic, iambic pentameter just dissolves,
So I'll say fuck you; suck your marrow like a chicken wing from pluck you.
Location I'll rock like Zeke, calamity.
What's your composure?  Shoot sex like Vanity; it's over.
Done it again; brainstorm slice in your direction.
Cut the belly of your block; open over to C-Section.
Death callin' one for the dysfunctional son.
Trapped in my digital domain... (The El to the P.)
Yo, fuck rappers that freak a fable; phony will make them fall out.
Frequencies painful; run 'em as sonar; CoFlow's the callout.
You're misaligned, I turn benign breaks into malignant.
Knock 'em out the box; capture they flag and kick they can in.
Badlands live one down the information highway.
Write a rhyme in braille; send a fuckin' battle to your e-mail.
Yes, once again empty MC's we have had here; for those
Fortunate enough to feel this; blessed number one, ichiban,
Numero uno crew; track runner, stun gunner, plus vocal.
Freak show performance.
Company Flow rockin' shit from the intro to the outro.
Nevertheless I must digress for the master;
The walking FreshFest MC's pure when in soil,
Yet shallow when the bank roll.
The independent representation of what MC's can and should be.
Judge, prosecution, defendant, and jury.
"New York... New York... New York... New York...
New York is number one today in the house!"

Could we try try bicycles coming from the sky?
My angel's head is drooping tuck my arms into my sides I listened for you now higher still break through the atmostphere and my voice is the sea hands are the heavens and my voice is the sea

Turn you into a bobsled
I'm a  popsicle stick
Drags you 'cross the desert wagon
Cut out from a tree

Soon soon all we'll do is blow blow around into the sound sound of my cloting on the chair lift me up into the air is something traceable I traced it with my finger on the kindergarten notepad with a voice from the sea

Turn you into a bobsled I'm a popsicle stick drga you 'cross the desert wagon cut out from a tree.
Meet you under the car tonight we'll make ourselves round round and round we'll go just like the earth and the wheels wheels of the clock keep ticking time time is a circle tim is a wheel everything comes back again just keeps happening never ends and if it ends it just starts againa nd again bury me under the sand pull my feet 'til they come off put them in the sky we tried to tell you here we are the pavement turns us into traffic signals maps of the world fold us up and put us in the glove compartment love department I miss the time when this made sense I miss the time when we were traveling traveling to Africa together in the fall the fall of man was in the springtime and I miss the time when you and I were hiking in the mountains and we took ourselves to try everyone tries it's my I turn to the sea and the sky I turn to the ocean the sea see

Cut out from a tree

To a one-time wizard
I just hope this dream will end
Reflections on the sidewalk are still breathing
Please let me see
I'm climbing on a ten-foot globe
Wizard, oh Wizard
I just got fired from the last job in town
I want you to turn the world into a giant cigarette
So I can burn it
Burn it like the flag

We're catching stars
On paper plates
In the morning

Brothers, oh brothers in the clouds
When will your hands be clean?
I want you to build a sand dune for me
Catch it like the wind in a butterfly's net
I refuse!
I refuse to let you straighten me out
My backbone of defence
My backbone of life
My backbone of wonder
My backbone of thought
My meter is running
Catch me if you can

Catch me
Catch me

Sunday morning in the valley we would gather for the service
Emily Jane would run to meet me she'd smile at papa kinda nervous
All the people came from miles around I can still hear the sound
As they sang thanks to the Lord for the sun up in the sky
For the corn that's growing high and for the child that didn't die
Thanks to the Lord for the crops and for the farm
For the strength in my right arm and for keepin' us from harm
Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks to the Lord for a girl like Emily Jane

Came the day that we were married all our folks from the congregation
Emily Jane was like an angel the sweetest thing in all creation
Papa hugged me and my mama cried everybody smiled with pride
As they sang thanks to the Lord

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for Sun in the sky.

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for clouds so high.

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for whispering wind.

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for the birds in the spring.

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for the stars so bright.

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for the wondering me.

Thanks a lot,

Thanks for the animals,
Thanks for the land,
Thanks for the people everywhere.

Thanks a lot,
Thanks for all I've got.
Thanks for all I've got.

We used to dwell in love's own palace
A palace of dreams come true
Now that we're through I bear no malice
Though we've called it a day
All I can say is
Thanks for all the lovely delights
I found in your embrace.
I'm thankful though I know
It's ending all too soon
And thanks for unforgettable nights
I never can replace
And memories that linger like a haunting tune
It is better to have loved you dear and lost
Than never to have loved at all
Yes it's better, for no matter what the cost
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise
We lost our road, but still I must convey our thanks

It is better to have loved you dear and lost
Than never to have loved at all
Yes, its better, for no matter what the cost
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise
We lost our way but still I must convey my thanks

There are new horizons with colors that I've never seen
The sky is filled with graces since you have carried me
I felt so far beyond your reach, but you gave everything for me
I was lost but you rescued my life

Why in the world did you come after me?
Thank you, thank you
Words aren't enough, but for now I can say
Thank you, thank you

There is hope rising 'cause you have strength I've never seen
And your eyes are shining 'cause you shed tears for me
I was miles from dry land, but you gave everything you had
I can't understand a love of this kind


I could find other lines that you haven't heard spoken over and over again
I've tried every way, but I keep landing on that simple phrase
So I'll keep singing, "thank you"





Thanks, thanks a lot

How 'bout getting off these antibiotics
How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up
How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots
How 'bout that ever elusive kudo

Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you thank you silence

How 'bout me not blaming you for everything
How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once
How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
How 'bout grieving it all one at a time

Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you thank you silence

The moment I let go of it was the moment
I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

How 'bout no longer being masochistic
How 'bout remembering your divinity
How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How 'bout not equating death with stopping

Thank you India
Thank you providence
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you nothingness
Thank you clarity
Thank you thank you silence

We thank Thee each morning for a new born day
Where we may work the fields of new mown hay
We thank Thee for the sunshine and the air that we breathe oh Lord we thank Thee
Thank Thee for the rivers that run all day
Thank Thee for the little birds that sing along the way
Thank Thee for the trees and the deep blue sea oh Lord we thank Thee
Oh yes we thank Thee Lord for every flower that blooms
Birds that sing fish that swim and the light of the moon
We thank Thee every day as we kneel and pray
That we were born with eyes to see these things
Thank Thee for the fields where the clover is grown
Thank Thee for the pastures where cattle may roam
Thank Thee for Thy love so pure and free oh Lord we thank Thee
Oh yes we thank Thee Lord...

Cross the road to meet me
Thought you'd never see
You opened up my mind so
I'm waiting to believe

Audition all emotion
Never follow doubt
Show me one direction
I cannot be without

Heard enough to reason
Muted every sense
Through the interference
I'm ready to receive

A glimmer of white promise
Found in you a gem
Call my intuition
I'm ready to believe

Ready to believe

"I despise a duck MC on the mic"  > Defari 'Big Up'




Rhymes and gems I run tracks like Ben Johnson

Dick Vytel said my style was awesome

P.T.P. MC

Prime Time Precisely

Word to Brothers I get Isely

And voyage to Atlantis black sea world of panthers

Where bothers don't question they answer

Mathematically with lyrics of strategy

The goal is to remedy the world of these wack MCs

Exactly, Defari lyrical athlete

Find me in the final heat of the Olympic track meet

For MCs

This kid he's not the average

I'm on the rise son like my name was Backstage Laminate

I got a cabinet of members all who posses spectacular vernacular

Blazing through contenders

I remember when hip hop was genuine

When gimmicks were limited

MCs were magnificent

Shows were omnipotent

The crowd was all feelin' it

If a kid had skills on stage yo he'd reveal it

But nowadays mad MCs need lessons in stage presence

Instead of claimin' they represent

While I enterprise, maintain, stay awake and wise

What you hear is what you get

No lies no disguise




"How did this bullshit happen?

Explain to me. How did this bullshit happen?"



"Rhymes and Gems"



"I despise a duck MC on the mic"




I like the milk I like the lactate

I like the milk type cords over a phat ass drum break

With skill my mind spins like windmills

For MC creeps I got noun and verb fills and brain pills

I combine dentistry with crainiology

Stacks of facts not mythology

So when I catch wreck to enterprise the land of the sunset

How much run should one don get?

I say plenty

That's word to Penny Hardaway

Hip hop is an arena and every show is like game day

On Sunday or Monday

Whatever day I play at a professional level

Here, in L.A.

And that's a raw fact no fiction in this guy

The essence of a pharaoh D to the E fari

The only weapon I brandish is my vernacular

Defari the tackler

Duck MC capturer



Hook




Word to the Barbershop MCs I got the remedies for enemies

Who possess flimsies

Concepts I bomb step to detonate

A vocal explosion as big as a tidal wave

See I'm that kid that you know that you never even heard about

Defari Heru will soon spread by word of mouth

Through every ghetto street, backstreet and phat jeep

I enterprise the west combine with strength plus finesse (Now how we go?)

I 'm blessed by Allah Almighty

Teaching class daily plus I'm writtin' rhymes nightly

Mad MCs be lyin' everyday

They be them same kids who drink pop off instead of Bombay

Saffire

The day will come when they expire

Retire or get sliced by this lyrical barb wire

They admire

While I wire a fax to my everyday contacts

Plans to make my cash triple stack



Hook




Thank you and good night.

In a land of O'Cahan where bleak mountains rise
O'er those brown ridgy tops now the dusky clouds fly
Deep sunk in a valley a wild flower did grow
And her name was Finvola, the Gem of the Roe

For the Isles of Abunde appeared to out view
A youth clad in tartan, it's strange but it's true
With a star on his breast and unstrung was his bow
And he sighed for Finvola the Gem of the Roe

The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
And he sighed for Finvola
The Gem of the Roe

To the grey shores of Alba his bride he did bear
But short were the fond years these lovers did share
For thrice on the hillside the Banshee cried low
Twas the death of Finvola the Gem of the Roe

The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
Twas the death of Finvola
The Gem of the Roe

No more up the streamlet her maidens will hie
For wan the pale cheek and bedimmed the blue eye
In silent affliction our sorrows will flow
Since gone is Finvola the Gem of the Roe

The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
Since gone is Finvola
The Gem of the Roe

Back across the ocean
A dark thought that lingers inside you
You left a crack in the doorway
What motivation propels you?
If that seal is torn, our fate is certain

Lay waste to all the Earth
We disappear
The one who ends all life becomes the hero

Ring down the curtain
No more illusions or lies
Our vile nature for hiding
Has opened up with the skies

Lay waste to all the Earth
We disappear
The one who ends all life becomes the hero

The ages are ending
Gone is the passing of time
Watch the angels descending
Gone is the holy divide

Lay waste to all the Earth
We disappear
The one who ends all life becomes the hero
Lay waste to all the Earth
We disappear
The one who ends all life becomes the hero

Did you see her
She's out of sight
Did you see
She's always cool and bright

Waiting for her, oh
You know you're wasting your time
With Monica Gems, oh
No matter how hard you try

People say, oh
She keeps them cool and bright
People say, oh
You're wasting all your time
With Monica Gems, Monica Gems,
Monica Gems, Monica

Did you see, oh
She's out of sight
Did you see, oh
She's cool and bright

Waiting for she, oh
You'll be waiting all your life
Monica Gems, oh
You know I think of her sometimes

Monica Gems
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Monica Gems, oh

And we've all been there for Monica, Monica
For Monica, Monica
For Monica, Monica
For Monica, Monica

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Violins and tambourines
This is what we think they mean
It's hard to say, it's sad but true
I'm kinda dumb and so are you

When the mystique varies thus
You can send a man to bury us
It's hard to say, it's sad but true
I'm kinda dumb and so are you

The last of the unplucked gems
The last of the unplucked gems
The last of the unplucked gems

When you held your hand to my heart
Dear you did something grand to my heart
And we played the scene to perfection
Though we didn't have the time to rehearse

Since you took control of my life
You have become the whole of my life
When you are away it's awful
And when you are with me it's worse

Lover, when I'm near you
And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear and breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's only trancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart

Well, I say that the devil is in you
And to resist you I try
But if you didn't continue
I would die

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart
To my heart, lover

Listen to my tale of woe,
it's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue.
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you.
So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awf'ly misunderstood
So lady, be good to me

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh lady be good to me.

Listen to my tale of woe, it's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue.
I must win some winsome miss
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
Which somebody just like you.
So

Oh sweet and lovely,
Lady be good,
Oh lady be good to me.
I am so awf'lly misunderstood,
So lady be good, to me.
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city.
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good, to me.

Auburn and brunette and blonde,
I love 'em all, tall or small
But somehow they don't grow fond,
They stagger but never fall.
Winte'rs gone, and now it's spring!
Love! where is thy sting?
If somebody won't respond,
I'm going to end it all.
So

Oh sweet and lovely lady, be good.
Oh lady, be

I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love

Listen to my tale of woe,
It's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all-alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh lady be good to me.

I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

You act like a prima donna
Playing so hard to get
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant
Draggin' on a cigarette
You keep a wall all around ya
I'll get through some day
I want your love, baby
Push, don't shove
Gonna chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama
I wanna get next to you

You stand like a marble statue
Trying to look so hard
All decked out in your antique dress
While the boys all promenade
Even a rock will crumble
If you strike it night and day
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust
Gonna chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama
I wanna get next to you

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
Honey, I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm wanna do
Sweet little mama
I wanna get next to you

Yes I do, yes I do

Chip away, chip away, at the stone
Chip away, chip away, at the stone

I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop

Chip it
I'm gonna nip it, all night long

Nineteen seventy one
We all heard the starters gun
New York is such a pity
But at Max's Kansas City we won

We all shot the shit at the bar
With Johnny O'Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
I'm surely gonna make us a star
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are

But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is goin' to trial

It was no surprise

The boys kept kickin' ass
As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Threw water on the fires of hell
She loved to show and tell
Lord she loved to tell

But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial

And it was no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise

Midnight lady
Situation fetal
Vaccinate your ass
With a photograph needle

I say
Look it here
Friend of mine
Scratch like you need calomine
Flamingo boots
Sole's a creakin'
Still in love and Puerto Rican too

Ridin' on the wheels of hell
Smokin' in our axle grease
Oh the backstage is rockin'
And we're coppin' from the local police
That's right the local police
Or the justice of peace

But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial

Baby it's no surprise
No Surprise
No Surprise
No Surprise

Rock and roll
Junkie whore
Got my foot inside the door
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock
Nobody's keepin' score

Bad times
Go away
Come again some other day
Topaz and sazzafrazz
Will keep the blues away

Candy store
Rock and roll
Corporation jellyroll
Play the singles it ain't me
It's programmed insanity

You ASCAP
If BMI
Could ever make a mountain fly
If Japanese can boil teas
Then where the fuck's my royalties

Arriving in boats, black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed, covered my head
But they're flushin' me out with a broom
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind
But she never got the feelin' to last
Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it
This is the critical mass
So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
This is the critical mass
Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall
Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas, we'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the critical mass
Time and space, is takin' me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day

It's the infamous back in the house once again
Livin the life that of diamonds and guns
And now gems pulls gats
Like a basehead pulls on stems
The mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on em

Take a tire, all these fake crooks need to retire
They gotcha gassed, takin back and snatch fire outcha
Maggot ass, havoc represent for the Q-B-C
Smoke that ass like a lucie tho I need to quit
Fuck it, I love it like a cloud
Over the projects your game I'm above it
Its combat, gats bangers and all that
You'se a small cat, whatever you on get off that
I mention, nuthin but the real shit presentin
The hollow tip crew 41st side convention
Try for you half-steppin Like a fresh tec out of the box
Yo niggas I'm testin (there's no question)
Bitch ass have you confessin
Like a d-t left in state of depression
You under pressure, intact no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher tookin wit asthma
You casper, you yell my name that's only givin me props
Plus the fans that you got, wonderin what's got you hot
Its too not, knocked out the box and got rocked
Got raped on the island, you officially got
Kick that thug shit, vibe magazine on some love shit
(Keep it real kid, you don't know who you fuckin wit)

It's the infamous back in the house once again
Livin the life that of diamonds and guns
And now gems pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on em

It's the infamous back in the house once again
Livin the life that of diamonds and guns
And now gems pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on em

Yeah likewise, I'm tired of rap guys whose faggots
Pure shut eye, and swole up your whole outside
I baptize, niggas get wet, put up your backside

Fed up with rain n forest fires,
There's nothing bold enough to say there is nothing at all.
These days are going fine, she's not a friend of mine,
There's nothing said so sweet,
Can anyone hear me?

I never wrote these lines see there rise from beyond,
See a friend of mine has a gift of song,
Delivered well,delivered clear my bird is singing in my ear.
I have a gem of a bird,
sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words,
The most magnificent words,
She puts the pen and the paper in my hand,
says things she does not think I understand,
But I know better than her.

Envision the position in the lower class den,
Think once then think again.
Money first then devastation
Won't pull these times are changing,
These days are going fine you're not a friend of mine,
There's nothing said so sweet,
Can anyone hear me?

I never wrote these lines see there rise from beyond,
See a friend of mine has a gift of song,
Delivered well, delivered clear my bird is singing in my ear.
I have a gem of a bird,
sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words,
The most magnificent words,
She puts the pen and the paper in my hands,
says things she does not think I understand,
But I know better than her.

And I tell you there's no one stealing Jupiter from me
and I'll tell you there's no one sings in better harmony,
No spaces for fickle minds on Kye Kye to fucking disagree.
I have a gem of a bird,
sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words
The most magnificent words,
She puts the pen and the paper in my hands,
says things she does not think I understand,
But I know better than her.

I have a gem of a bird,
sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words
The most magnificent words,
I have a gem of a bird,
I have a gem of a bird,
But I know better than her.

I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.
Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';
'Cause I really love you, baby.
Oh, I really love you, darlin.

Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';
'Cause I really love you, baby.

Oh, I got a man
Sho 'nuff a real man

Good ol' man is what I got
Good ol' man says he helps a lot
A real man gone be tender
Maybe that's the kinda man I need

For his love I will surrender
'Cause he'll keep his mind on pleasing me
'Cause he's the

Right kinda lover
I'll never need another
Sho 'nuff, he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me

An interesting conversation
Every once in a while
Always prompt and attentive
'Cause me diamond knows that dime is my star
'Cause he's the

Right kinda lover
I'll never need another
Sho 'nuff, he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me

I'm not an innocent debutante baby
I've lived enough to know
Infatuations don't mean that it's forever
So I decided to take it slow

But when I saw you a voice deep inside me
Said you would be the one
To fill my life with the joy I have dreamed of
And warm my nights like the morning sun

[Chorus]
I'm in love
Finally
I've found someone for me
I'm in love
Can't believe
That I'm living my fantasy

Took me a while to reveal all these feelings
Cause I was so afraid
I'd messed it up by exposing my emotions
Scared I'd be giving it all away
Since I've surrendered my heart to you darling
I haven't been the same
Because of you my whole life has come together
Your tender kiss has erased the pain

[Chorus]

Wherever you lead me
That is where I would want to be
Ooh loving you is so easy
Cause it just comes so naturally

[Chorus]

My life has meaning now since you came
I've been changed in so many ways
You've turned my heart around nothing can bring me down
I'm feeling free and my life's a song

There's no other way to describe
What it is that your kiss does to me
You give good love to me, satisfy all my needs
You make me feel so alive

This word is all, I have to say
I love you in every way
(This word is all)
All that I have and all I can't hold back
With a feeling like that

When you are gone and this feeling comes on
I'm content all alone till you come back home
You are the one for me, I'd give you anything
Just to keep you satisfied

You shared with me so unselfishly
And I'll never take you for granted your heart, oh no
You are the peace of mind that seemed so hard to find
I'll never want to let you go

This word is all, I have to say
I love you in every way
(This word is all)
All that I have and I'll never let go
Cause I'm loving you so

I've been in love before
And you know I really thought that I had it all
'Til I met you and then I knew
I never had the meaning of love 'til I found you, baby baby
'Til I found you, you, you

This word is all, I have to say
I love you in every way
(This word is all)
All that I have and there's no holding back
With this feeling I've, I've got a feeling, oh

This word is all, just hold me, you know me
(This word is all)
And all that I need is you baby
(This word is all)
This word is all

I don't know what to say, baby
(This word is all)
I never knew what I'd miss, baby, oh
(This word is all)
I love you, oh I want to say
(This word is all)
I love you, oh oh, this word is all, oh oh oh, oh

Never
Never stopped loving you
Never
Stopped loving you
Never
Stopped loving you
Done a lot of things
In my life
And at times
I found the answers
To some questions
That were heavy on my mind
Every fantasy
Ceased to be a mystery
To me
Done a lot of things
That I have lived to regret
But all the moves I made
Were not enough
To help me forget
In solitude I find
Your kiss stays on my mind
After all this time

(Chorus)
I never stopped loving you
I only did what I had to do
Though we've been
So far apart
You kept your
Place in my heart
I never stopped loving you
Shared a part of me with you
I let you touch
That secret space
Inside my hungry heart
That couldn't get enough
I just can't forget
What was so perfect

Your scent
Your touch
Your kiss
Your everything
Stays burned in my memory
And it keeps me yearning
To share some smiles again
Like we did back then
My old friend

(Chorus)

(Repeat Chorus)

And God only knows
Just how far I would go
To get back together
With you
Do you suppose we could bloom like a rose
When it's kissed
By early
Morning's dew
I ain't gonna do it
Cause I can't get through it, no
I never stopped loving you
Oh!
I, I never stopped loving you
I only did what I had to do
Oh, we've been
So far apart, hon
You kept your place in my heart
I never stopped loving you
Oh
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Oh, oooo
So far
Got a place
In my heart
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

She wears my ring to show the world that she belongs to me
She wears my ring to show the world she's mine eternally
With love and care, I placed it on her finger
To show my love for all the world to see

This tiny ring is a token of tender devotion
An endless pool of love that's as deep as the ocean
She swears to wear it with eternal devotion
That's why I sing because she wears my ring

To show the world
She's mine eternally
With loving care
I placed it on her finger
To show my love
For all the world to see
(This tiny ring is a token
Of tender emotions
An endless pool of love
That's as deep as the ocean)
She swears to wear it
With eternal devotion
That's why I sing
Because she wears my ring
She swears to wear it

Color in sky, prussian blue
Scarlet fleece changes hue
Crimson ball sinks from view
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love)

Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may
Wear my love like heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like heaven (Wear my love)
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Color sky, havana lake
Color sky, rose carmethene
Alizarin crimson
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love)

Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may
Wear my love like heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like heaven (Wear my love)
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Cannot believe what I see
All I have wished for will be
All our race proud and free
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like heaven (Wear your love)

Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may
Wear my love like heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like heaven (Wear my love)

We all wear cloaks
We all wear cloaks
We all wear cloaks
We all wearrrr, cloaks

Salamander rolling zig zag
Marching to a humdrum
Between the truth and a cryptogram
Like skeletons struck dumb
In a closet gilt in camouflage
All the secrets of the world
Your conscience running rough shod
The swine are throwing back your pearls

We all wear cloaks
We all wear cloaks
We all wear cloaks
We all wearrrr, cloaks

Don't let anybody find out
What a lamb could never tell
Who conceals it with a smile, yeah
Like a crack in a liberty bell
Put a dollar in a martyr
Who rode a dead horse home
Through the eye of a needle
That burst the bubble of a holy ghost

We all wear cloaks
We all wear cloaks
We all wear cloaks
We all wea-ah-ahhh!
Ah ah uh ah!
Ah ah uh ah!
Ahhh...Cloaks!

Daddy isn't funny and i don't wear red/money never really been a friend.

And sunny isn't something that i'd call myself but i ain't never going to leave a mess on your wall

Mommy gets afraid when there is no stress but the medicine won't let me get depressed.

And i'm afraid of having too much confidence when i'm choking on the meaning of success and no stress

if you knew how many times i have flown into your room just above your bed, maybe you would like me more or less/

i just don't want you lookin in my head

now brother is embarrassed by all of us so the more we try, the more he moves away.

but what if he's right and i'm ridiculous?  would the old vacation pictures look the same?

Wear my ring on your finger
Wear my love within your heart
And say, you'll always be
As much in love with me as at the start

Wear my ring on your finger
And make this solemn vow
That you will always be
As much in love with me as you are now

And when we're old and we're gray
We will still have this day
To remember when December comes in May

Right now he's looking for his pants and socks
Can't find the car keys on the dresser top
He'll spill his milk and leave it in the kitchen floor
And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more
He'll go to work without a kiss from me it'll cross his mind he siad I'd never leave
Forget his coat and catch a deaf of core
And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more
[ dobro ]
He'll tell the guys he's bothered not at all
Then drink his lunch so he won't have to call
He'll tell himself I'm home like the day before
But as the day wears on he'll doubt it more and more
He'll come home to a house that's dark and quiet
And has to face another sleepless night
He'll watch TV and read and walk the floor
And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more
And then he'll phone and ask me to come home
That things have gone to pieces cause I'm gone
His phonecall is all I'm waiting for
Cause as the day wears on I'll miss me more and more
Cause as the day wears on I'll miss me more and more

When youget this letter dearest darling
I' ll be on the train heading home
My thoughts are only of you, love
While these many moons I've roamed



    Meet me there down by the river

This world and all of its pleasures
Can't take the place of home and you

Or is another there instead

The highlight was wrong
The highlight was dead and gone
Too many crowns makes his head feel low
Too many soldiers on his back
Too many needles makes veins explode
And I know he's not coming back

We could be strong and misbehave
I might be wiser than you
Coming when the race was run
These hands of mine are torn
And he knows this now
He knows this now

We could be strong
We could be brave
We could make everything seem okay
Find this night
Find a light
Find a place to color in the sky
The sun is raining again
And I won't waste these hands of mine
Who knows when this time
Who knows when this time

The headlights were down
The headlights were down and round me
Too many coffees pulls his head to the wall
Too many stories under me
Too many voices now I'll silence them all
And you'll be there taping up my knee

We could be strong
We could be brave
We could make everything seem okay
Find this night
Find a light
Find a place to color in the sky
The sun is raining again
And I won't waste these hands of mine
Who knows when this time
Who knows when this time
We could be strong

I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner, in the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line

I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck, ooo
Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims
And the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so, ain't that so

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Meal ticket

Crash the sound
You lose your hand
To understand
The accident is red

You are a fruit fork
And the money you look up
And the madame you look up
And the middle you look up
A wonderful wooden reason

They know they got to stole the cake, I motivate

Fiends dealas, ballas, hatas, shops and boppas
Jekyll and Hyde, Bonnie and Clyde, and niggaz
That ride with glocks and choppas where we out

Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket

Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket

Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket
Tryin' to get a meal ticket

Arrange the books
Clean up the small table by the sofa
Arrange my clothes
Shape up the place

Eager for the meeting
The dinner we'll be eating,
Wine that we'll be drinking
And kinky thoughts I'm thinking,
All because of you

And now I've found a partner,
No one can be, happier than I am
And now I've found a new friend,
No one can be, happier than me

Prepare a meal I can make
Sing funny songs while it's in the oven
Then take a bath with bubbles
Shape up my face

Just before our meeting
The dinner we'll be eating,
Wine that we'll be drinking
And kinky thoughts I'm thinking,
All because of you

(Don't want to be stumblin' baby)

[Chorus]
This is for them hustlers scufflin' for them ends
Tryin ta get a mill, (fancy cars) and a house on the hill

I dwells in the city, a bank is where ya bound to suffer
Lifestyle filled with hoodsters, players and hustlers
Busters want to shut me down, I suppose
'cause I'm makin cash flow as my ghetto life dispose
I gets my hustle on from dust to dawn, Perignon
(Damn, how my life transformed like Voltron!)
Chargin like Natron by any means
These collard greens is goin' quicker than the forests are evergreen
Now one-time tryin ta shut me down 'cause I'm on a
Mission makin' ends in my Benz bendin corners

Fools be Coupe deVille yet still I stay real wit mine
If the ten reaches dome, so long! So catch me next time
So, wordly rhymes they been kind to me
Hoes lie to me, make me try to be what they not, see
I'm gonna call you Wimpy (Can I please bawl, word?)
A dollar a day and ya gladly pay me back tomorrow
Hell no! I feel no sorrow, I scuffle to get this mill
I've excelled, grab a grip, need no chip for this packed 10

[Chorus]

Triple beam, thirty schemes and crack fiends
Got me to the point where I can make my 6-4 lean
Hard times got me bussin' cheques that ain't mine
I got good credit but like I said it ain't mine
I'm stressed out and I need paper therapy
I'm sick and tired of family and friends takin' care of me
I'm on a one-way ticket to lavish homes and cars
Do anything to make a mill and be a ghetto star

Well what'd make you laugh or make you cry?
Where things that come faster
Live it last and the weak'll surely die
Multiply life times death, what's left?
A big house on the hill and I can feel this best quest
As Uncle Sam ain't the man he supposed to be
We out here gettin' lynched while most niggas baggin' groceries
Most of these wannabe's get they meal ticket
Claimin' they from hoods
It's still too good but they don't still kick it

[Chorus]

Livin' the lifestyles of the po' and lonely
Only takes my mind to mold to make a grip of money
Funny how time flies when you ain't broke
Gotta gets me a mill 'cause I feel I can't cope, though
I'm down and out in the S-see, less see
Gimme a biz and then get rid of Betsy
I know the whole world on first name basis
But still I get ignored by friends in high places
The chase is on, I gots ta get paid
I'm special like ed. so you can say I got it made

My flows got it buggin', don't mess with my Clicc man
Snap lyrics like a picture, make em say Dougie's a sick man
Hustle every day that's the way that I was brought up
Gotta make more chips than Ruffles, scuffle, sneaky plan thought up
Caught up wit Tone Def, not Fargo, or will I wells
Landcruiser, swimmin' pools and watchin' my pockets swell
Dosha all the time, all about that money money money!!!
Wit a top-notch crew now all my jokes is funny

Arrange the books
Clean up the small table by the sofa
Arrange my clothes
Shape up the place

Eager for the meeting
The dinner we'll be eating,
Wine that we'll be drinking
And kinky thoughts I'm thinking,
All because of you

And now I've found a partner,
No one can be, happier than I am
And now I've found a new friend,
No one can be, happier than me

Prepare a meal I can make
Sing funny songs while it's in the oven
Then take a bath with bubbles
Shape up my face

Just before our meeting
The dinner we'll be eating,

And kinky thoughts I'm thinking,

A lot of niggas lie, shit we do or die
Everyday we high, it's like a nine to five
I got my nina my fo'-heata beata by my side
I keep it tucked close when I'm on the West coast (West coast)
I keep it on post when I'm with my East coast folks locs (East coast)
Y'all know what's crack-a-lacking
I'm from the hood of the drive-bys and kidnappings, and car-jackings

On our way to the mall, fuck all of y'all
We gon' ball til we fall, watch the chrome crawl
Intercept these fine bitches cause we want 'em all
Dropping drawers, popping coochie and licking balls
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs
Only real ass niggas get to set it off

[The Lady of Rage]

Grab a microphone have flashbacks and start flashing,

String you up like you was on the Ponderosa
Sip on Mimosa do it that way cause I'm supposed ta

Ain't nothing shitty about this here fuck around and that's that ass
Just like, grass I, I want more Green than the Goblin
Matter of fact I want more Bank than that chick that be modeling
My Uzi weighs more than a single ton
I leave you single son, who wanna mingle not a single one

Make that cheese, when the cops come you bet' not freeze
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies
Lock you up and fuck you up
Talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up

We set it off, Snoop Dogg!
It's "Tha Last Meal"
Last time y'all suckers gon' eat off my big homeboy
We set it off!
We set it off! West coast

I am lost inside your lair
And allowed you to lure me here
You promised immortality
I've become your newest meat
And I am ripe for the feast
And I am dripping form their mouths

Well eat what's left of you before we're through

The lust for blood within reach
We've woken under your feet
No longer
Frightened by these vampires
This situation is clear
No longer clouded by fear
Like cornered dogs we'll turn and
Bite the hand that feeds but does not kill

Sleep and dream
Hiding from the day
Pay no mind to shapes that wind
Around you where you lay there will be time for waking
There will be time for taking
But who?
But you-
Parasites come in many shapes
And you forgot that we have teeth too
While you were feeding off our blood we
Became one of you
There is something coming that you forgot me friend
The very beast that you create is the one who'll slay you in the end
You thought I'd go down easy
But now you're coming
With me
You'll burn with me
You'll never take us alive

I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner, in the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims
And the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so, ain't that so

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick
Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the president
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (bitch)
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the top dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.
Smash motherfuckers thinking they goin' smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the "world's most dangerous group"  N.W.A.

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talking shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e
C-p-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick
Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!

Gallons of hennesey and 16 liters of coke

Popping our collars, tossing up dollars
A truck on the side of with hoes that wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard then it gets harder
It's not a, thing on mine, I bang on mine
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfucking bimbo
So quit knocking at my window, you nympho-maniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're getting what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?

[Chorus]
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? (Snoop Dogg)
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts (Snoop Dogg)
Who got a girl laying on her back? (Snoop Dogg)
Who's that making that paper stack? (Snoop Dogg)

You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo' thing, this my song

Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys and park my car
No snap shots cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, giving 'em props (what up, what up)
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshitting (no bullshitting)
We be sitting, in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sitting in the sauna
Burning up the charts (burning up the charts)
Break a bitch heart, lil' mama don't you start

Slap me 'cross the face around two o'clock
But the party don't stop till we blow up (ka-boom!)
Now every lil' bitch wanna show up
Manuev'in to this, grooving to this
Dipping to this, flipping to this, tripping to this
Ain't no skipping to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say..
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you 'round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rolling down the motherfucking backstreets





Cameras flashing snoop interviewing Bill Clinton
Yo hold on hold on hold on hold on
Stop the cameras stop the press stop the press
Now bill this yo' nigga snoop dogg
Now answer me this did you fuck that bitch or what

Bill Clinton
That's actually not the first time that question's been asked but
Since I believe and I think any person reasonable person would
Believe that that is not covered in the definition of sexual
Relations I was given ahh I'm not going to answer it except to
Refer to my statement I had intimate contact with her that was
Inappropriate I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
Her violated the definition I was given therefore I believe I
Did not do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie hie
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie hie

Lies lies stories and alibis
Big mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high

[Snoop Dogg]
You trying to cover up the holes in your sneakers
You need to put your motherfucking face to the speakers ba bom ba bom
And quit trying to run from it holla holla at me
And see'mere you big dummy dumb ass nigga
Don't you know you can't run from the dizzogg
I'm down with za the long arm of the lizzaw
Why y'all niggas know what's happening you turn your back again
And I'm bound to get it crack a lin I'm back again
And everybody happy for me ain't that the truth
That's a motherfucking lie fuck that fool
Black folks stick together til we die hmm
That'll be the day

[Chorus 1]

[Snoop Dogg]
Liar liar pants on fire
Smoke so much dope they call me snoopy pryor well god damn
Which way is up I'm trying to get higher
I won't stop puffin til I re tire
My bitches my niggas they off the wire
They lovely they love me call me sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett Tyra Mariah the fliest the flier
See most bitches like fucking with a rider
Slider to the sider invite her
To a gangsta party provider laughing
With a lot of meat by products mm
And beat the puddy pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom
Woo woo woo woo that's a bad bitch
Then she grabbed me by my nuts and said hmm I got 'em

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Kokane
Ah what's the use of the truth
If you can't tell a lie sometimes

Whats up nephew?
Sitting here chopping game, my nigga Bad Azz
Niggas get the misconception of us
cause we so cold at what we do
But I really wanna let niggas know what's happening though
You feel me?

[Chorus]
Now I don't want anybody
to get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothing to hide
I want the world to see,
I'm a gangsta gangsta
Gangsta niggas do your dance
(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Popping collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoeing cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay selling, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thugging off on the stereo
Killing 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothing, we keep getting more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?)  Holla at 'em

[Chorus]

I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool man
Go on and do yo' thing, gang-bang
in the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showing me around they house, then he slide me in the back
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out man
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfucking L.B.C.
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist
I'm real with this, deep as abyss
I gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss
I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullshit





[Snoop]
Let cho' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'all
Talking bad about me, and my motherfucking dawg
He ain't tripping, I ain't tripping, but y'all niggas still dissing
To me, some of these suckers'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you living
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is "The Villain"
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chilling
Now as time flies by I see the game getting mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?
I always tend to come with it
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
I'm too young to retire, I'm having fun wit it
See when you learn what to do with it, I'll be done with it
Come with it

Go (just go away) go a-way!
Niggas can't be trusted
(Just come back another day)
Niggas be on bitch shit
(Just go far, a-way)
Niggas get it twisted
Just go a-way

[Snoop Dogg]
Now she said she don't like a G
Well listen here bitch, get the fuck from 'round me
You thought you was bout to get a drink on me?
I put hands on you bitch like Suga Free
I always let a bitch know her boundaries
Same with a nigga, I treat him like a flea
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot
Motherfucker, you will get popped
Not, knowing who you fucking with, niggas be on bitch shit
Nigga we be fucking quick, nigga we ain't talking shit
When the heat's spit, niggas be on bitch shit
Trying to get somewhere, covering up they biscuit
And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick
But when I leave, you niggas pulling trick shit
But it's cool, cause niggas gonna miss this
Cause I'ma keep it all business, what is this?

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I said let yo' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes
You fools, these fools, new fools, all y'all
Talking bad about me, and my motherfucking dog
He ain't tripping, I ain't tripping, but y'all niggas still dissing
Look here bitch, some of these niggas'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is "The Villain"
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chilling
Now as time fly I see the game getting mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?
I always tend to come with it
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
Too young to retire, I'm having fun wit it
When you learn what to do with it I'll be done with it

Fell all up in your motherfucking ass

Putting it back on the map

To a dimension you never thought existed

[Chorus]

Dark-eyed woman on a hot summer's night
Dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight?
Dark-eyed woman won't you step in the light
And tell me dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight
Tonight

Dark-eyed woman it's a quarter to four
I hear your voice
Like a child at my door
Dark-eyed woman I could love you once more
But dark-eyed woman we've both been there before
Before

Dark-eyed woman on a hot summer's night
Dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight?
Dark-eyed woman won't you step in the light
And tell me dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight
Tonight

Good morning Mister Blue, we've got our eyes on you
The evidence is clear, that you've been scheming
You like to steal away and while away the day
You like to spend an hour dreaming
What will it take, to whip you into line?
A broken heart? A broken head?
It can be arranged. It can be arranged

Step softly Mister Blue, we know what's best for you
We know where your precious dreams will take you
You've got a slot to fill, and fill that slot you will
You'll learn to love it, or we'll break you
Oh, what will it take, to whip you into line?
A broken heart? A broken head?
It can be arranged. It can be arranged

Be careful Mister Blue this phase you're going through
Can lead you nowhere else, but to disaster
Excuse us while we grin, you've worn our patience thin
It's time to show you who is your master
What will it take, to whip you into line?
A broken heart? A broken head?
It can be arranged. It can be arranged

Don't worry Mister Blue, we'll take good care of you
Just think of it as sense and not surrender
But never think again, that you can think again
Or you'll get something you'll remember
What will it take to whip you into line?
A broken heart? A broken head?
It can be arranged. It can be arranged

I'm looking at your soul, your soul, your soul, your soul
I'm looking at your future, your future, future, future
As I look into your eyes, these eyes, these eyes, these eyes
I see another side, side, side, side

Vampire, you're(you) feed on the life of a pure heart
Vampire you suck the life of goodness
Vampire, you're(you) feed on the life of a pure heart
Vampire you suck the life of goodness

Turn the lights on
Let the lights shine bright
Turn the lights on
Let the lights shine bright

You've got to feel yourself and let go
You got to know you reap what you sown(sow)
You've got to feel something at sometime

Check the writings on the wall
And look into the sight
You're spending all your money on gare(gear) that never work
you're wasting all your energy and everywhere it hurts
God it really hurts
yes it really hurts
you got to know yourself

Vampire, you're(you) feed on the life of a pure heart
Vampire, you suck the life of goodness
Yes
Vampire, you're(you) feed on the life of a pure heart
Vampire you suck the life of goodness

From now on I'll call you England
From now on I'll call you England
From now on I'll call you England
From now on I'll call you England

See if you spit in the sky
It will fall in your eye
You see what goes up must come down
You will die looking up if you're not looking in
you've got to know yourself

I'm looking at your partners and they would never agree
I'm looking for your justice and it can not be seen
I'm checking where you're coming from and where you're going to
I'm checking all off what you have done to see what you can do
I'm looking at your lawbooks and they were never read
I'm looking at your lovesquire and they can not be thread
I'm looking at your empire living on the drears
You've got to know yourself

Vampire, you're(you) feed on the life of a pure heart
Vampire, you suck the life of goodness
Yes
Vampire, you're(you) feed on the life of a pure heart
Vampire you suck the life of goodness

From now on I'll call you England
Empire fall man, empire go
From now on I'll call you England
There's a lesson to be learned
Why is it that, you must know
From now on I'll call you England
and the rich that you eat is more like food that you fear
From now on I'll call you England
gotta see no love anyway you appear
From now on I'll call you England
you've got to know yourself
from now on I'll call you England
you've got to know yourself

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

Only time will tell, where we take it.
Poison in my soul to watch her fake it.
97 lies taking its toll down from the top, take your time let's go.

I still remember the times when we were young.
I still remember that two hearts were better than one.

So stop
Don't turn around
It's hot
Don't go

I'm starting at the end in the synthestereo, candy covered kisses making my lips glow
97 lies
What we don't know
Down from the top now, take your time let's go

I still remember the times when we were young.
I still remember that two hearts were better than one.

So stop
Don't turn around
It's hot
Don't go

Sometimes we don't know how to let go from you and me

I still remember the times when we were young.
I still remember that two hearts were better than one.

Perfect picture alone together,
On a roof top late one night.
You said, "hold on never let go",
And the city never looked so bright.
Do you still think of me now?
Do you still think of me now?
'Cause it's never enough,
I came here alone,
I can't remember where we are.

I see your body burnin out of control
Control ya know
I feel it comin under
I feel your body burning out of control
Control ya know
I feel it comin under

Saw your eyes shut in a daydream,
A love locked up in chains,
When you woke up,
You knew I was waiting,
With a hand that's never straight.

I feel your body burnin out of control
Control ya know
I feel it comin under
I feel your body burning out of control
Control ya know
I feel it comin under

Diamond stars are hiding out,
Tell me what you want to know.
(Ohh) Shattered pictures are falling down
Tell me that you want me to know
(I keep fallin down)
Silence gone and take us around
Take us around (ohh ohh)

I feel your body burnin out of control
Control ya know
I feel it comin under
I feel your body burning out of control
Control ya know
I feel it comin under

Ohh I feel it comin under you

I have seen you in this place ever since I was a little boy
Reaching out from every corner of this room
It's so good to see your face, once again from a child's eyes
I can see You Father Your coming over me

Like the nature of a child
Lord you let me walk in to the wild
But I can hear you call me back to you
Your coming in loud and clear

As I turn my face to you I can see that everything is true
When I come back home I know I'll find you here
Too many years I've done without till I found someone to
sing about
Makes me wonder what I've been doing all this time

Like the nature of a child
Lord you let me walk in to the wild
But I can hear you call me back to you
Your coming in loud and clear

Lord You bring me to my knees
Just when I thought that I already knew you
I couldn't hold you to anyone
I take the hand that made my hand
You opened up my eyes
I didn't know you till I knew your son

Like the nature of a child
Lord you let me walk in to the wild
But I can hear you call me back to you
Your coming in loud and clear





You're gonna miss the wood
Everyone left the wood
Take what you can carry
Find a road and follow

Of course I'm supposed to work I -
come from the hills I -
Find and eat food I -
try to protect I -

Of course I like to laugh I -
look at the sky,
look in your eye

All I feel is transition
When do we get home?
all i feel is transition
Now to be alone
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

You're gonna miss the wood
I come from the fen I -
I left the den

The wind blows no good it -
Tells of a change that
Might rearrange

can't see the ground it's -
Not where it was

All I feel is transition
When do we get home?
All I feel is transition
Now to be alone
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

The stars are indifferent to astronomy
And all that we think we know
Mars will salute your autonomy
But he doesn't need to know

All I feel is transition
When do we get home?
All I feel is transition
Now to be alone
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

No one wants to live this fiction
Where didn't we go wrong?
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

The stars are indifferent to astronomy
And all that we think we know
Mars will salute your autonomy
But he doesn't need to know

The stars are indifferent to astronomy
And all that we think we know
Mars will salute your autonomy
But he doesn't need to know





You're not alone what you were seeing I was thinking
And I know you couldn't do it alone, uh-oh...
What could it be what could it be
Maybe it's me, I've got to know
I was talking never thinking its becoming too much for me,

What could it be would could it be maybe

Your lips, Careless lies faster than a whisper
Look for your starry eyes, Because I know you care

[Chorus]
Break up, Monday and its over
Make up, Tuesday on my mind
Friday, I'll be coming over
Blue skies together
It's all I've got

I'm up, but coming down
You said nothing last forever but forever is all we could be,
But I see away I see away

Your lips careless eyes, I never should have kissed her
We're both telling lies, but I know you care

Break up, Monday and its over
Make up, Tuesday on my mind
Friday, I'll be coming over
Perfect together
It's what we've got

[Chorus]

Sometimes silence is the answer
I keep promises of mine
How can you tell me that it's over
Blue Skies together

Break up, Monday and its over
Make up, Tuesday on my mind
Friday, I'll be coming over
Perfect together
It's what we've got

[Chorus]

I can tell you that you're the right one
You can tell me that me that I'm the right one

Maybe you're heart kept coming down

Sex (Sex)
Sex (Sex)

Her heart is on her sleeve and it is looking right through me
You gently vicious slowly never felt so naked
So break me down until I fall but stop before you break it all
I never thought you'd cry, I thought that you would make it

Stop me
Not for long
Dancing from below
Stop me
Not for long
I think I might have let you go

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care
Sex, not love
It's only make up sex

Breaking up the silence with the things she knows
I think I might have pushed to hard for her to go
I can hardly take what my voice will make
I can't believe the time I almost had to let her know

Don't stop just get it on
Don't stop just get it on

Stop me
Not for long
Dancing from below
Stop me
Not for long
I think I might have done you wrong

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care
Sex not love
It's only make up sex

I think I've got it right
I think I've got it right

So stop stop me you know I cannot breathe I cannot breathe
Into your heart I cannot see
So stop me now
I think I might have let you down

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care
Sex, not love
It's only make up sex

Sex (Sex)
Love (Love)
Sex (Sex, sex, sex)
Love (Love, love, love)

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care
Sex, not love
It's only make up
It's only make up
Sex

Another lover with a tragic past
Pretty girl, I thought it was forever
We walked together on a darkened path
I closed my eyes, and I saw the picture

Do you remember, the desperate times that we had?
Do you remember, can you remember a promise long ago?

Can we give it a chance?
If it's love we can wait
Let's forget the past
For a moment of faith
I've had it up all the times
I've seen the look in your eyes
You can't hide, your careless lies

And as you drift into a fearless night
Dream away, your kiss is coming
Wake up to lost skies, this is where we belong
Open arms, and I think I'm falling

Do you remember, the desperate times that we had?
Do you remember, can you remember a promise long ago?
(I promise)

Can we give it a chance?
If it's love we can wait
Let's forget the past
For a moment of faith
I've had it up all the times
I've seen the look in your eyes
I've had it up all the times
I've seen the look in your eyes
You can't hide, your careless lies

Give it a chance (If so I can wait)
For a moment of faith (It's so hard to wait)
So give it a chance (If so I can wait)

Can we give it a chance?
If it's love we can wait
Let's forget the past
For a moment of faith
In the dreams we dance
You are sleeping away
Let's make it last
For a moment of faith
I've had it up all the times
I've seen the look in your eyes
I've had it up all the times
I've seen the look in your eyes
You can't hide, your careless lies
You can't hide, your careless lies

Your careless lies

And your heart, is a stained and secret face
And your heart, was touched and melts away

Slow down, slow down
It's not the promises you keep but the sidewalks where you sleep
So wake up, Wake up
Jet plane dreaming, street rat screaming

Living like the movies
She was glitter today
I don't see her that way
Living like the movies
Well I can only pretend
The beginning's the end

And your tears, dissolve the hurt within
And your heart, is a shallow covered sin

Slow down, slow down
It's not the promises you keep but the sidewalks where you sleep
So wake up, Wake up
Jet plane dreaming, street rat screaming

Living like the movies
She was glitter today
I don't see her that way
Living like the movies
Well I can only pretend
The beginning's the end (and the end, and the end, and the end)

All the trashy starlets falling from the sky
I open up my arms catch one, two, three floating by

Living like the movies
She was glitter today
I don't see her that way
Living like the movies
Well I can only pretend
The beginning's the end (and the end, and the end, and the end)
Living like the movies
(and the end, and the end, and the end)
Living like the movies

I want to live until I want to die
Struck by the note I had to leave behind
So don't save me
Let me sleep

Cut your self one thousand times
The picture fades away

Wake up someday
Sleep late sunday
Make up my way
Kiss me
What have I done

I can't help but get to you this time
For me to find you this time
What have I done

I have to live but when I want to die
Words for the lost when they're left behind
So don't save me
Let me sleep

Everything means something
Don't you miss your misery

Wake up someday
Sleep late sunday
Make up my way
Kiss me
Wake up someday
Sleep late sunday
Make up my way
Kiss me
What have I done

Darkness far away this could be real

Wake up someday I'll sleep late Sunday

Wake up someday
Sleep late sunday
Make up my way
Kiss me
Wake up someday
Sleep late sunday
Make up my way
Kiss me

I can't help but get to you this time
For me to find you this time

What have I done?

I've done you wrong so many nights before, can I still
Say I'm sorry
I blame myself for all the love has gone, there's a
Part of me that's empty

That was you who saved me then
(Darkened by the photograph)
But you're gone and I pretend
(Beneath the red light)

Dancing with strangers, dancing with strangers all
Night
Dancing with strangers made me the stranger this time

It's too late to change

I dream about the love I used to know, can you say
You're sorry
Come lie with me and you can be my love, without you
Sunday is missing

Was that you who spoke to me
(Darkened by the photograph)
In a dream where everything
(Through the twilight)

Dancing with strangers, dancing with strangers all
Night
Dancing with strangers made me the stranger this time

Love is intoxicating, It's too late to change

So come on, don't let go, of the words that you know, I
Can feel you there, so come on, turn the lights out...

Dancing with strangers, dancing with strangers all
Night
Dancing with strangers made me the stranger this time

Say that our love lasts forever tonight

Sing a song
But make it as sweet as it's sung
So you know that
You can feel playback in a funny way
And every day it's you
They're stealing the peace away from you
And before long
You become someone you never knew

With all the time
In all the world
You'll never find
Such a pretty girl
And all times that you've said it
I'm never going to turn around, regret it
It's written on every page
You're still the same
You're still the same

And you never show me
Much of anything at all
And you never show
Much of anything
Much of anything at all

And I think sometimes that I don't care
It's the same thing every day
You turn around and you change
Then I kiss all of your tears away
And I can't see forever
And you go on like never before today
I know I should have seen
But I'm not that clever

You might singe
Like a cigarette
I'll tell you things
That you might forget
And you don't want to find a place
You can't escape from
The way your heart's strung
On the bass drum

'Cause you never show me
Much of anything at all
And you never show me
Much of anything
Much of anything
And don't you worry now
Don't you worry now
'Cause you never show me

With all the time
In all the world
You'll never find
Such a pretty girl
And all the times that you've said it
I'm never going to turn around, regret it
It's written on every page
You're still the same
You're still the same

'Cause you never show me

S-s-sweetness
So spin with the girls in the parking lot
She says, "Yes I'd like to get to know you
You can see so I will show"

I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry
Say sorry
Say so
I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry
Say sorry
Say so

And if it feels alright
She may not be the right one
And if it takes all night
It may not be the right time

Yes I'd like to get to know you
You can see so I will show you
Yes I'd like to get to know you
You can see so I will show

And if it feels alright
She may not be the right one
And if it takes all night
It may not be the right time

Don't go
Try to tell me no
Don't go
Oh-oh-ay-oh
Don't go
Tell me something I don't know
Don't go
Break down this wall

And if it feels alright
She may not be the right one
And if it takes all night
It may not be the right time

The right one
The right time
The right time
The right one

No one, no one knows he's sorry
No one, no one knows he's sorry
No one, no one knows he's sorry
No one ever knows he's sorry now

Monday evening waiting for your sweet release I paid
You for it, you're dark and unravel softly fascination
Accidently, shadows I would steal, I broke you up like
A kiss face down, lined you with time listen 'round,
Lost your fame and fortune swings, uglyness pretty
Things, started with a kiss, and now it's come to this...

Bleached white seconds after midnight paranoia
Day light, till your coming down coming down, black out
Isolation carried out, desperation freak out, till your
Coming down coming down

Desperate pose and the way it shows, you were torn
Without your clothes, broken hearts never came for me,
Hidden cuts are a mystery, spinnin' from within, and
You don't care for anything

Bleached white seconds after midnight paranoia
Daylight, till your coming down coming down, black out
Isolation carried out, desperation freak out, till your
Coming down coming down

Just because I understand you doesn't mean that I don't
Hate you

Cross the street you called and tripped a chalk line
From, and the sound of the daytime on your white wrist
And the terrified feelings on your painted fingertips

Did you know me, when you were living free, and didya
Didya didya know me, when you were living free

Bleached white midnight paranoia day light, black out
Carried out, desperation freak out freak out freak out
Freak out freak out freak out freak out ? so long.

Running from the nightmare
In the middle of the road
Hell's no place for sleeping
In a world beyond control
Caught in the headlights
Coming after you
When i woke up this morning
I had to do what i gotta do
Blast me to heaven for loving you
Blast me to heaven for loving you
Speed
Give me what i need
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Speed
Oh, let it bleed
Yeah
Greased lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
I've seen a train full of pain
On the edge of overload
We're in heaven, baby
You are gonna implode
I've got these crazy feelings
That i can't explain
I've gotta save you baby
Or i'll die in vain
Blast me to heaven for loving you
I said blast me to heaven just for loving you
I said speed
Give me what i need
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Speed
Oh, let it bleed

Greased lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Blast me to heaven for loving you

Now i'm rushing on the run, yeah
I want to have me some fun
I'll speed
Give me what i need
Oh, set me free
Let's speed
On wheels, on wheels, on wheels
Said speed
Oh, let it bleed

Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Com'on
I said speed, speed
Give me what i need
I said speed, speed
Give me what i need
Alright

Running from the nightmare
In the middle of the road
Hell's no place for sleeping
In a world beyond control
Caught in the headlights
Coming after you
When I woke up this morning
I had to do what I gotta do
Blast me to Heaven for loving you
Blast me to Heaven for loving you

[Chorus]
Speed
Give me what I need
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Speed
Oh, let it bleed
Yeah
Greased lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels

I've seen a train full of pain
On the edge of overload
We're in Heaven, baby
You are gonna implode
I've got these crazy feelings
That I can't explain
I've gotta save you baby
Or I'll die in vain
Blast me to Heaven for loving you
I said blast me to Heaven just for loving you

[Chorus]

Blast me to Heaven for loving you
I said blast me to Heaven for loving you

Now I'm rushing on the run, yeah
I want to have me some fun
I'll speed
Give me what I need
Oh, set me free
Let's speed
On wheels, on wheels, on wheels
Said speed
Oh, let it bleed
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
C'mon

Give me what I need
I said speed, speed
Give me what I need
Alright

Can anybody fly this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life
Inside a bubble
We've been living life
Inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

Can anybody stop this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life
Inside a bubble
We've been living life
Inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

High speed
High speed

High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed

I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister, what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch
Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter, no I don't need leather seats

Speed, an' how fast will it go
Can it get me over her quickly
Zero to sixty, can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
An' a whole lot of speed

I'd like to trade in this old truck
'Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love, where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long, but now she's gone
An' I need to move on

[Chorus]

Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rear view mirror, there's nothing left to see here, yeah
Let me lean on that gas, oh she catches up fast

[Chorus]

That's what I need
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I'm tired of spinning my wheels

I'm on a mission, I'm gonna break the speed of sound
My pulse is racing, I'm gonna have to chase you down
Acceleration gotta, gotta go faster
Give me more speed
They say I'm crazy and I'm headed for disaster
Give me more speed
No competition,left in my dust - they'll never learn

This is my rocket, my aviation fuel is set to burn
You want to rock and roll at a million miles an hour
Just put your foot to the floor, c'mon and feel the power
I know exactly what I'm after
I know exactly what I need
I need the speed

Yea

I rough voco  for my locos.

My nigga Hi see  2nd II None  AMG



And the Q you the new

You knew

I (?) to any particular groove

I came ok now

Check it if you want to but it's all in vein

Because me game is stil the same

Perfection!

Fill me as I fill you in

I never rode a pony but I'm genuine

So give me just a little bit of nicotine

And a sticky greeen

And I'm a hit it with the icky cream

Booyah I hit her on the neck with a whip

And made the hooker jump without a safety net

Hit the ground break her back

Get up and do it again because she can really take a shot on the chin

caffeine cappucino chase it with some no-doz

Up all night like the moon glows

Searching for new hoes

They really want to follow my lead

indeed and give a nigga just what I need




When I'm on speed

I'm faster then most

And I can rock a party from coast to coast



The Q-you-I-K is the name I spell

124 beats per minute I rock well

Because I'm tight to the second power

When I hit the liquor

And I don't serve emcees

I'm serve dickas

Bang bang boogie

When I hit a shot of loogie

And the Booger try to put it on me

But I get that moves to show her

I flaunt it like Noah

I strut backside like a Boa

Constrictor when I dicked her down

Game feel just like a circus clown when I work this

Jack of all trades

Master to few

Test these test these 1, 2

Gettin down with my nigga AM to the G in the PM

Hookers want to see him

Big cat callin

Superfat ballin

Indeed

Give us what we need

When I'm on speed



Chorus 4x



Faster then the concord

On board

Call me the pilot

Baby better let me know she's excited

In the testerosa

Sipppin memosas

Girls want me to sign posters

International with the steelo

Got hookers from Cancoun to Reo

Fire (?ignite it?)

But we don't even try it

You can't but it

Got freaks have to hide it

Hit the weed up

Then turn the speed up

The booty from the backs the only way I eat up

Quicker than Jackie Chan

I search off the Goochi like a rubber band

You want to be more than the average man

But the hoe needs more a job in a man

And a retirement plan

So baby don't cry the blues

Cause I know a gang of hoes in your shoes



Chorus 4x

La da la da da da ('till fade)

Love is born with lightning bolts
Electro-magnetic force
Burning skin and fireworks
A storm on a raging course

Like a force of nature,
Love can fade with the stars at dawn
Sometimes it takes all your strength
Just to keep holding on
At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

Love is born with solar flares
From two magnetic poles
It moves towards a higher plane
Where two halves make two wholes

Like a force of nature,
Love shines in many forms
One night we are bathed in light
One day carried away in the storms
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster
Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

We don't have to talk
We don't even have to touch
I can feel your presence
In the silence that we share
Got to keep moving
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster
Than the speed of love
Got to keep on shining
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster
Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed demon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your ticket right"

And nothin' gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed demon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your ticket right"

Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like
For me there's no tomorrow

Go! Go! Go! Go! Aaow!

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket
I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon)
I just, pull over boy and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
I just, pull over boy and eat your ticket
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and get your ticket right

Pull over boy
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and
Get your ticket
Eat your ticket
Get your ticket
Eat yo', get yo'
Get your ticket right

B boats float from the coast
Binoculars watch the bales float to shore
Tryna find ways to tax this dope
Slanging bars like soap
Bitches high off of these lines like coke
Listening with they eyes closed, with no clothes
She want fuck because of my flow
It's like I got X pills inside my quotes
Smoke, keep me on a high note
Oldies playing in my Chevrolet
Game make them ladies want stay
Plot all night, bust moves all day
It's just the jet way
No time to sleep 'cause that won't get me paid
Don't make sense if it don't make dollars
Excuses won't start my Impala
If it ain't about my paper then "I'll holla"

Came through, killed niggas
Satellite coupe with the new stickers
Never running with no new niggas
Just my OG's and some cool bitches
Bad ones, I know what to do with them
I don't buy them no bags, I just get them high
All she really wanted to do was ride
I'm a let her, won't sweat her, no pressure
Let her decide, she smart
She gon definitely choose what's better
Autumn weather, in a vintage ice berg sweater
Fly beyond measure
That's your girl you better check her

Cherry beamer, drop Saab
Sipping pass Ace Boogie
He mad at his bullshit job
Mentality I had as a younger
Grinding hard to provide a yard for my big dogs
Rest in peace to the Jacker, may you mob
No love in the streets my nigga
They don't give a fuck about you or me my nigga
Just an era where a nigga is killing these niggas
And these bitches just mirroring the television
Fake hair, fake ass looking for a real one
Just tryna fuck a nigga with a million
And do anything to get one

Take me with you
My soul is on

Get back with your heart attack

Can I ride your motorbike?
Karaoke nights by the sea
Bomber jacket hyperspace
Leather laced in 3D
Water's crashing
Road keeps turning on

So hold on, hold on
Take me with you
My soul is on

Can I stay with you?
Make it easy for me
You are the most selfish kind
Nevermind what I need
Water's crashing
Road keeps turning on and on and on

So hold on, hold on
Take me with you
My soul is on
Hold on, hold on

Sliup - Ummm - Crack
Goes the backscreen door
She wanted to go for coffee
But I sleep an hour more

See Mary dancing across the porch
She put her rolled up Ziggys in her rock and roll jersey
Jersey, she was born to run
She was the spirit of midnight

She was blinded by the light
She was holed up in jungleland
Straight up
The rock and roll big boss

Turnpike down by the river of desire
Just off Thunder Road
Where you catch her in the Tenth Avenue
Freeze out

She was lost in a flood
Mary, Queen of Arkansas
Dreaming of a Cadillac ranch with a hungry heart
But most of all she was born in the USA

Ashbury Park, New Jersey
Inner state babe
To be exact she was her own rock and roll video
Rolls Royce, low riding

Speed climbing, driving by the sea
Making mad love on other people's private property
While being on the run from the local law for unpaid parking tickets

Can I stay with you?
Make it easy for me

Are you a tramp like that?
Are you born to run?
If you's a tramp like that
Come on, give me some

You like your guitars fat
You like your beach with bum
I never had no fun
Come on, let me ride shotgun

'Cause I'm a tramp like that
Yeah, I'm a tramp like that
And I'm gonna give you so much
New Jersey girl

We gonna ride around
New Jersey girl
New Jersey girl, New Jersey sun

Bring it on
Hear me scream

How y'all feel out there?
I can't hold it back

Crawling, to the path of the righteous
Crawling, to you again, to you again
Crawling, up and down a mountain
Crawling, then up again, then up again

Could you ever admit to yourself
That you must walk in the light of the past?

Not invited, to cry out loud
I'm a brother, stone cold true
Love and suffer, Siamese gold
Left divided, so I trudge on out

Could you ever admit to yourself
That you must walk in the light of the past?

Not invited, to cry out loud
I'm a brother, stone cold true
Love and suffer, Siamese gold
Half divided, so I trudge on

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling, up and down a mountain
Crawling, to you again

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling, up and down a mountain
Then up again

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling, I'm
Crawling, I'm
Crawling, I'm
Crawling

I'm crawling to you

Setting sail from a crushed rooftop
Fathoms deep, shallow as a raindrop
Attempt to feel 20/20 now
React like gasoline cornered by a house fire

You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean

Beneath the tides of the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout

Cut from the filthy cloth
A sucking would left in our chests
Being burned around the heart
The boil under your flesh

Hidden at home
Chasing a tucked tail now
Acting on the instinct
Of self haphazard yet

You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean

Beneath the tides of the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout

The saving down, the saving down, the saving down
In milligrams with a gun in your hand
Directionless, directionless
Memories of combat on your head

Rain can't soak what is not there
Rain can't soak what is not there
Rain can't soak what is not there
Rain can't soak what is not there

The first thrill demands another
Consequence, the trigger of the operative
Playing Russian roulette with a full chamber
Miserable outcome, one and the same want to know

You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean

You can't come clean
(Beneath the tides of the washout)
You can't come clean
(Beneath the tides of the washout)
You can't come clean
(Beneath the tides of the washout)

In the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout
In the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout

You couldn't ever come clean
Beneath the tides of the washout, washout

Woe to me, battered man
Raise the monolith
Deitize my spirit rise
Like days the world forgets - down the

Drain - laid to lame
A fool-ass hearty bliss
Borderline suicide,
Celebrate before my death

Your promised land divide,
That's why the world lies.
I give up.
That's enough. I give up.

I'm underneath my life.
Dog in heat, beware the street
It's there you'll meet your end
Poverty is not for me,

But I'll take her back again
To prove a point,
To laugh it off, to cross you off my path,
Grip the night, pull the cord,

A much inspired wrath.
Your promised land divide,
That's where the world lies.
I give up.

That's enough. I give up.
I'm underneath my life.
Carry me back from the war
And from the lord.

That brave river, I can't sail.

Because of that lone feeling,
That I might fail.
So fuck it.
I just smoke let me feel stoned
6th hour.
I still fail to rise,
And I cower in
Reality's eyes, so I
Just smoke

Let me feel stoned
Let that paranoia cut
My head off.
I'm low down
Crying shame today smoke stoned
I have fallen
Scattered the wave
Alone I'm crying
Broken shade
So I just smoke let me feel stoned
I can't feel you
You can't brave (the river?)
No more sadness no more pain
Not what feeds you but what raves
No more sadness no more

Woe to me, battered man
Raise the monolith
Desensitize my spirit rise
Like days the world forgets, down the
Drain, laid to lame
A fool-ass hearty bliss
Borderline suicide,
Celebrate before my death

Your promised land divide,
That's why the world lies.
I give up.

That's enough. I give up.
I'm underneath my life.
Dog in heat, beware the street
Its there you'll meet your end
Poverty is not for me,
But I'll take her back again
To prove a point,
To laugh it off, to cross you off my path,
Grip the night, pull the cord,
A much inspired wrath.

Your promised land divide,
That's where the world lies.
I give up.

That's enough. I give up.
I'm underneath my life.
Carry me back from the war
And from the lord.

Woe to me, battered man
Raise the monolith
Deitize my spirit rise
Like days the world forgets - down the

Drain - laid to lame
A fool-ass hearty bliss
Borderline suicide,
Celebrate before my death

Your promised land divide,
That's why the world lies.
I give up.
That's enough. I give up.

I'm underneath my life.
Dog in heat, beware the street
It's there you'll meet your end
Poverty is not for me,

But I'll take her back again
To prove a point,
To laugh it off, to cross you off my path,
Grip the night, pull the cord,

A much inspired wrath.
Your promised land divide,
That's where the world lies.
I give up.

That's enough. I give up.
I'm underneath my life.
Carry me back from the war
And from the lord.

My brain distorts the pleasure,
No facts behind my eyes.
This pain I've come to treasure,
Being down has become my life

Don't know which one is real,
Been kicked in the groin
I drown the way I feel,
Thought I will to go

Losing all

I'm lord of misery
I'm king of the hill
I'm a broken man of the world
In a state of

My wrists are slit,
I'm losing all.
Gun at my head,
I'm losing all.
My bones are broken,
I'm losing all
Last time I had,
I'm losing all

Losing all

Losing all
Sing it
Losing all
Louder
Losing all
Yeah

Started from the start
Wearing out the headstones
Was the end, was the right
Taking out a life loan

Hey, old man
When I'm going six feet down
You gotta make that promise to me
A stained glass cross lay behind my head

When taken by the undertaker
No questions anymore
It's higher than the black sky
Get you lower than the floor

Hey, old man
When I'm going six feet down
You gotta make that promise to me
A stained glass cross looking down on me

Hey, old man
When I'm going six feet down
You gotta make that promise to me
A stained glass cross hanging over me

I was just a young boy
My father sounded crazy
My death he couldn't bear to see
Either joking, sleeping, lazy

Hey, old man
When you're going six feet down
I gotta make that promise to you
A stained glass cross lay behind your head

Hey, old man
When you're going under and down
I made a secret promise to you
A stained glass cross looking down on you

Pray to someone
I'm going out of my head
Dislocate
Stay safe in your unmade bed

Lysergik funeral procession

The world is watched
Straight from your TV sets
Makes you ill
Turn off and drop out in spurts

Lysergik funeral procession

I get up, get ready to face this world
I come down
I come down so hard, I hit then bounce
In a pool of piss I lay

Once revived, I was better off like I was
In so many pieces
And I'm so damn mad, so fucking mad
To lose that special darkness
I've got nothing to lose

Been through a lot in the last year
It's like everything I love is slipping away
And every time I come home
Some more of me isn't there
I gotta get it together
I need to do things for myself
I've given everything
But still you take more from me
I need some room to breathe

Come on, come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be okay!)
Lets go back, lets go back
To a time where I still felt I had a family

This isn't what I remember
Everyone's looking out for just themselves
If need be I'll be happy to leave
Just be warned, I'll be taking most of you with me
I see straight through
That smile straight through
That painted face
Don't think that I can't tell
Which one of you is against me

Come on, come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be okay!)
Lets go back, lets go back
To a time where I still felt I had a family

I had the greatest faith in fools,
I turned my back and out came the wolves

PAY ATTENTION!

Come on, come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be okay!)
Lets go back, lets go back
To a time where I still felt I had a family

Been through a lot in the last year
It's like everything I love is slipping away

We sit in the car outside your house
I can feel the heat coming 'round
I go to put my arm around you
and you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
well you let out one of your bored sighs
Well lately when I look into your eyes
I'm goin down

We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night
We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down

I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out
I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild
But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down







Fast, a cleansed soul rebirthing
See to be and understand your flip side

You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return

All is cry until the laughing
There is more between the sky and earth
That is beyond our philosophy unknown

You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return

The closest that need you, the closest surrounding you
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away

We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away

The closest that need you, the closest surrounding you
The closest that need you, the closest surrounding you
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away

We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away

And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home

And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home

Go slow

Cruel to himself and generous about it
Cruel to the world, not hard to spot it
Can't give up, shut up on a tirade
Off the top of his head, so ripe becoming rotten

He's hit the wailing wall
To pass out hard upon
He's kissed the wailing wall
In the thrall of it all

In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all

Failed his name, no care to hide it
Failed escape that's documented
Instilled or distilled, the spike or the chill
It's immolation, the **** of nonexistence

He's hit the wailing wall
To pass out hard upon
He's kissed the wailing wall
In the thrall of it all

In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all

Headstone tells nothing about him
Headstone reads two decades wasted
A funeral pyre, no one to burn it
Because self-destruction brings misfortune

In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all

No lower heaven for his bones
Nor handing life back what it's owed
Caretaker careless, what he's sown
Porously reaching his lowest low

The negative has just begun
Joining the war, impossible

In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all

In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all
In the thrall of it all

Been to this place before, excavation
Scrawling a name again
Touch stony face restored
Can't read the name, collapsible fingertips

Weeping within the hot of desert weeps
To brood inside the skull of wax and time
Taking no step alone until you can
Crying on the downed stones
Crying on the downed stones

(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
Oh, pillamyd

Fuck in the vessel head, working with slaves
Dust in the eyes of men
Offer nocturnal prayer, alter ablaze
Magic obtained, deciphering pain

Moving inside you when you seem asleep
Influence all to step beyond the gate
When you're slipping in preservative
Hydroglyphic downed stones
Hydroglyphic downed stones

(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
Oh pillamyd

A pillamyd built
Pillamyd guilt inside
[Incomprehensible]

It's etched in stone
It's etched in stone
It's etched in stone
It's etched in stone

(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)

I try when there is no such thing
And hide rejecting, rejecting

Reaching for a handful
(Yet still the pain goes on)
Reaching for a handful
(Yet still the pain goes on)

Reaching for a handful
(Yet still the pain goes on)
Reaching for a handful
(Yet still the pain goes on)

Countdown, countdown, countdown

From the inside looking out
And building and building and building
And building and building and building

Close the door
Lay in bed
Cigarette
Aching head

Never try, never try
You either do it
Or don't waste my time
No, no, never try

Frustration
Out patient
Handcuffed man
To himself

Navigate slowly
A step at a time
Towards the law

Never try, never try
You either do it
Or don't waste your time

Never try, never try
You either do it
Or don't waste your life

Try

Never try, never try, never try
You either do it, do it, do it
Or don't waste the time

Shreds of life
Eyes cried dry
Touch no thing
Burned outright

Navigate slowly
A step at a time
Towards the law

Never try, never try
You either do it
Or don't waste your time

Never try, never try
You either do it
Or don't waste your life

Never try, never try
You either do it
Or don't waste my time

Be something that amounts to nothing the threat
A wrecking ball plowing through our karma
We have no confident voice in our ears for tonight
Exist in memory only headline

We have been through change, by the season of the storms
It's irony, the cleansing
Except eccentric faith, to need religion to sit high
Among the elect on march the saints

There's no such thing as a good time for bad luck
As minutes turn to distressed fragmented moments
Reading lips unable to hear the talk
Partake no tangible out in tomorrow

We have seen the change, from the season of the storms
It's irony, the cleansing
With all our lives at stake from at rest to present are sitting high
Among the elect on march the saints

March
March
March
March

We have been through change, by the season of the storms
It's irony, the cleansing
Except eccentric faith, to need religion to sit high
Among the elect on march the saints

On march the saints
On march the saints

All scorn me
A monster should be feared
Witch hunt blame
Regret and fuck the day

I scream

Fallen leaves
From the same family tree
Wind blown halves
Regret is all that's left, all that's left

Words cut deeply, no secrecy
So long since seeing, my life time appealing
The two are not healing
I cannot help feeling regret, regret

Reflecting on our memories
We know the pains of living
And I know he's seeing both of we
Regret he would not want to be

I scream
I scream
I scream
I scream

I scream
I scream
I scream
I scream
I scream

Sick of a sickness, a reoccurring nightmare of
Convulsing through slow tempo dance
Liberation requiem, stamped out curriculum
Oh, that doppelganger laughing, manifesting wings

The dark side, the dark side
Drop trip

Lost on a trip, no acid can supply
Because L.S.D. ain't what it used to be for me
Inside of dead weight standing, speaking with authority
Black smoke is swirling upward masking

The dark side, misanthropy skin deep
The dark side, the children of extremes
The dark side, will warn a fool indeed
The dark side, you'll have to carry that weight

You fight, you will fight
Against the strands, so ill advised

The dark side, misanthropy skin deep
The dark side, the children of extremes
The dark side, will warn a fool indeed
The dark side, you'll have to carry that weight

I'll fight, I will fight
Against the strands, so ill advised

We'll never know when
Someday will bring our own
Sudden

Last time, last time, last time, last time
Last time

I'll fight
You say you want a revolution
I'll fight
You say you want a revolution
I will fight, I will fight
And carry that weight

You say you want a revolution
I'll fight
You say you want a revolution
I will fight, I will fight
And carry that weight

All felt is hope to spilling over
Needs are a passing memory fear not worthy
Belief, a martyr's burden
Heaved upon capable shoulders

Dissuade your charge
Arrive in commonplace with the elect
The furthest plateau
Inside the souls of saints

The old dog has to learn a new trick and more
Or the next trick will be on him
I've drank the oceans dry, I've stopped the time
Embraced the riddle of regret
(Again and again)

Desire, haunt me long
The light of three suns and one star
Watch over me

A square will never fit a circle
No hope, no joke, both bookends burned
I've drown in oceans mine, I woke the dead
And still the dry bones live again
(And again with me)

Desire, haunt me long
The light of three suns and one star
No higher, keeps us strong
The light of three suns and one star
Watching over me

In me, watching closely over me
In we, moving within you and me
In deep, our own ideology
Oh yeah, yeah

In me
In me
In me

In me, staring through and through to me
X-ray, hanged for all to see
Naked, frenzied and we're free
Our own ideology

Desire, haunt me long
The light of three suns and one star
No higher, keeps us strong
The light of three suns and one star
Watch me

Three suns and one star
(Watch over me)
Three suns and one star
(Watch over me)

Three suns and one star
(Watch over me)
Three suns and one star
Oh yeah

Three suns, one star
Three suns, one star
Three suns, one star

We can make it, I know we can
Only time will tell
Let's take a walk down to the water
Let's go the well
You hear that low humming underground
Hear the skylark in the dell
The wild world is speaking
Let's go to the well

Sometimes my heart feels like a dandelion
Seeds scattered in a careless wind
And nothing to show for my life and time but
Innocent wonder in the face of thunder
Feeling like something is about begin

Let's build a bonfire
For the stories we tell
Of wild years, the wasted tears
Ant he silent way they fell
See the curls of smoke rising up
To the big old sky as the moonlight falls
Down over those distant hiss
I don't want to be anywhere else anymore
Let's go to the well

You better believe my faith in you
It is wide and steady as a Texas moon
And when this stuff starts rolling through
Its as all innocent wonder in the face of thunder
Feeling like something is coming soon

We can make it, I know we can
Only time will tell
Let's take a walk down to the water
Let's go the well

And let's go down to those hills through the
Trees across the rocky path
Down to the Blanco river
Come with me darling, the sky is a so big today
My heart's so full
C'mon, lets go to the well now, babe

Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
I took my loved one out to dinner
So we could get a bite to eat
And though we both had been much thinner
She looked so beautiful I could eat 'er
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well

I took my loved one to the big field
So we could watch the English sky
We both were nervous feeling guilty
And neither one of us knew just why
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well,
Well
Well
Well
Well
Well
Well
Well
Well, well

Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well

We sat and talked of revolution
Just like two liberals in the sun
We talked of woman's liberation
And how the hell we could get things done
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well

I took my loved one to a big field
So we could catch the English sky
We both were nervous feeling guilty
And neither one of us knew just why
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, oh well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well!

I took my bucket down to the well
There's a (desert?) woman, sweet mystery
She let the rope fall down in the well
Like it was meant to be

She put the jug upon her head
Walked with her back to the wind
I followed her tracks the moment she said
"Why don't you come in?"

[Chorus]
She killed the light, she dropped her glove
She said "Are you looking for trouble,
Or looking for love, love, love?"

I woke in the morning dying of thirst
Headed straight back to the well
There she was with a jug on her head
The rope had just fell

The well in her eyes was deep and black
With no question or answer
She wiped my brow and I followed her back
To the Tropic of Cancer

[Chorus]

You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me

No you don't know the one
Who dreams you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
Well you don't know me

For I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy
I let my chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
You'll never, never know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me

"Hey! sit down and cool it for a minute so we can hear what we're gonna do. and those of you in the band
Who have no idea what's about to happen, this is in a minor and it's not standard blues changes."

"Oh, my god!"

"But it's close!"

"This is a song that I used to sing when I was in the cavern in liverpool. I haven't done it since so..."

Two, three, four!

You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well, well;
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well, well,
You know I love you, honey child,
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you at night.
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well.

You know I love you, baby, please don't go;
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, uh -

There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you right now.
You know I want you, baby, please don't go, well.

Well, you know I love you, baby, please don't go, well;
You know I love you, baby, please don't go,
You know I love you, honey child,
Nothing that I wouldn't do for you right now.
I know I love you, baby, please don't go, well, well.

Hey!

In every heart there is room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I fear I've said too much
My silence is my self defense

For every time I've held a rose
It seems only felt the thorn
And so it goes and it goes
And so will you soon, I suppose
But my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice ere mine to make
But can make decision, too
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes and so it goes
And you're the only one
Who knows

There is a well
Down by the hollow
Its waters deep
As they can be
Thousands come
And millions follow
All to see
What they could see

Now some see light
And some see violence
Some see might
And some see flow
But all see truth
Deep down in silence
As they pass the booth
Where the tickets go

I am the well
I am the well

I call to all
Who cannot hear me
I call to those
Who hear as well
And those I touch
When they come near me
And those who hurt
But cannot tell

I am the well
I am the well

I am the waters
Never ending
I am reflections
From the past
I am the stream
Never bending
Until you reach
The truth at last
The truth at last
The truth at last

I am the well
I am the well
I am the well

Well, she's up against the register
An apron and a spatula
With yesterday's deliveries
And tickets for bachelors
She's a moving violation
From her conk down to her shoes
But she's just an invitation to the blues

But you feel like cagney
And she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single
She's a loner, likes to mingle
Got to be patience, try to pick up a clue
She says how you gonna like'em
Medium or scrambled?
Any way is the only way
Be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase
And a ticket getting out here
It's tired bus station
And an old pair of shoes
Ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues

But you can't take your eyes off her
Get another cup of java
And it's just the way she pours it for you
Joking with the customers
Oh mercy, Mr. Percy!
There ain't nothing back in jersey
But a broken down jalopy
Of a man I left behind
And a dream that I was chasing
A battle with booze
An open invitation to the blues

Ah, but she's had a sugar daddy
And a candy apple caddy
A bank account and everything
Accustomed to the finer things
He left her for a socialite
He didn't love her except at night
And then he's drunk
And never even told her that he cared
So she took the registration
Car keys and her shoes
Left with an invitation to the blues

Now there's continental trailways leaving
Local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat
I'm sticking round here for a while
Get a room at squire
The filling station's hiring
And I can cat here every night
What the hell have I got to lose
Got a crazy sensation
Go or stay, I gotta choose
I'll accept your invitation to the blues

Light floats down day river, on a red raft of blood
Night blocks out the heaven, like a big, black, shiny bug
Its hard soft shell shinin' white, in one spot, well
It's hard place, that I'm livin', but I'm doin' well, well
The white ice horse melted, like a spot of silver, well
Its mane went last, then disappeared the tail
My life ran through my veins
Whistlin' hollow, well
I froze in solid motion, well, well
I heard the ocean swarmin' body, well, well
I heard the beetle clickin', well
I sensed the thickest silence scream
Then I begin to dream
My mind cracked like custard
Ran red until it sealed
Turn to wooden and rolled like a wheel, well, well
Thick, black felt birds, a-flyin'
With capes of solid chrome
With feathers of solid chrome
And beaks of solid bone
And bleach the air around them
White and cold well, well
Till it showed in pain
The hollow cane clicked like ever after
Its shadow vanished shinin' silence, well, well

Leave it all behind,
Leave it all behind,
Leave it all behind,
Leave it all behind,

I have what you need,
But you keep on searchin',
I've done all the work,
But you keep on workin',
When you're runnin' on empty,
And you can't find the remedy,
Just come to the well.

You can spend your whole life,
Chasin' what's missing,
But that empty inside,
It just ain't gonna listen.
When nothing can satisfy,
And the world leaves you high and dry,
Just come to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more,
And all who search will find what their souls long for,
The world will try, but it can never fill,
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

So bring me your heart
No matter how broken,
Just come as you are,
When your last prayer is spoken,
Just rest in my arms a while,
You'll feel the change my child,
When you come to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more,
And all who search will find what their souls long for,
The world will try, but it can never fill,
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

Yeah
Leave it all behind

The world will try, but it can never fill, leave it all behind

And now that you're full,
Of love beyond measure,
Your joy's gonna flow,
Like a stream in the desert,
Soon all the world will see that living water is found in me,
'Cause you came to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more,
And all who search will find what their souls long for,
The world will try, but it can never fill,
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

Leave it all behind, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind, leave it all behind

Mountain maker
Ocean tamer
Glimpses of You
Burn in my eyes
The worship of heaven
Fills up the skies

You made it all
Said, "let there be"
And there was
All that we see
The sound of Your voice
The works of Your hands
You do all things well
You do all things well
You do all things well

Star creator
Wind breather
The strokes of Your beauty
Brushed through the clouds
Light from the heavens
Touching the ground

Imagination runs wild
And breathes the breath of life
Across the fields
Across the miles

Jimmy fell down his papa's well
he met the serpent from hell
hypnotized by the stare
Jimmy was never seen, never seen again

The night grew cold
Jimmy's legs grew weak
he rasied the flag of defeat
stuck in the limbo, Jimmy joined the team
no one heard his screams

Why did you have to play
with substances genetically placed
combined with your addicitive brain
you never came back to me
you never came back to me





Light floats down day river, on a red raft of blood.
Night blocks out the heaven, like a big, black, shiny bug.
Its hard soft shell shinin' white, in one spot, well.
It's hard place, dat I'm livin', but I'm doin' well, well.
The white ice horse melted, like a spot a silver, well.
Its mane went last, then disappeared the tail.
My life ran through my veins,
Whistlin' hollow, well.
I froze in solid motion well, well.
I heard the ocean swarmin' body well, well.
I heard the beetle clickin', well.
I sensed the thickest silence scream.
Then I begin to dream.
My mind cracked like custard.
Ran red until it sealed.
Turn to wooden and rolled like a wheel well, well.
Thick, black felt birds, a flyin',
With capes of solid chrome,
With feathers of solid chrome,
And beaks of solid bone;
And bleach the air around them.
White and cold well, well.
Till it showed in pain.
The hollow cane clicked like ever after.
Its shadow vanished shinin' silence.
Well, well.

You know I love you, baby, please, don't go, well, well
You know I love you, baby, please, don't go, well, well
You know I love you, honey, child
'Cause nothing I wouldn't do for you right now
You know I love you, baby, please, don't go, well

You know I love you, baby, please, don't go
You know I love you, baby, please, don't go
You know I love you, honey, child
Nothing I wouldn't do for you right now
Why'know I love you, baby, please, don't go, well
Zappa!

You know I want you, baby, please, don't go, well, well
You know I want you, baby, please, don't go
You know I love you, honey, child
'Cause nothing I wouldn't do for you right now
You know I want you, baby, please, don't go, well

Well, you know I love you, baby, please, don't go, well
You know I love you, baby, please, don't go
You know I love you, honey, child
'Cause nothing I wouldn't do for you right now
I know I love you, baby, please, don't go, well
Yeah!

It's raining so hard
Looks like it's gonna rain all night
This is the time
I'd love to holding you tight
But I guess I'll have to accept
The fact that you're not here
I wish the night would hurry up and end,
My dear

It's raining so hard,
It's really coming down
Sitting by my window
Watching the rain fall to the ground
This is the time
I'd love to be holding you tight
But I guess I'll just go crazy tonight

It's raining so hard,
It brings back memories
Of the time
When you were here with me
Counting every drop
About to blow my top
I wish the rain would hurry up and stop

I've got the blues so bad
I can hardly catch my breath
The harder it rains
The worse, the worse it gets
This is the time
I'd love to be holding you tight
But I guess I'll just go crazy tonight
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight

My home has been a warrior field
Where now and then I've seen
A rainbow rising over the graves
Down in the gentle green
And as I waltzed across the mine
Time sped to breathlessly
As I fought for love
And I sang for love
Too late, love comes to me

I saw you coming over the hill
So strong, so brave, so true
I fell down to my knees and cried
The way I used to do
It came at such surprise to me
I thought those tears had passed
Is it god who laughs this heart awake?
Too late, love comes at last

O lovers how they come and go
Like waves upon the shore
Brave hearts can drown in the briny deep
And still cry out for more
My treasure's in the water now
My pearls are lost at sea
And my heart must bend like a rainbow
Too late, you've come to me

I had a dream, woke up shaking
The moon breaking through the tress
And in the stillness of the evening
I heard a rustling in the leaves
And I saw a panther in the yard
Moving slow across the ledge
With silver eyes and a cool regard
And hunger with a cutting edge

Open the door, let it in
This mystery you found
It's all yours now
Come lay the panther down

So I called the eagle and the raven said
My prayer to the sky with the moon as my witness
I looked the panther in the eye and beheld
His violent beauty
That cut so deep and hard
Through my civilized indifference
And reckless disregard

So I open the door and let it in
This mystery I found is all mine now
Time to lay the panther down

Yesterday I thought that I walked alone
And that love was just a memory
But a nightingale
Followed me back home
Where my love was
Waiting there for me

I have lost my faith as lovers often do
When the storm clouds gather overhead
But a nightingale sang a note so true
That I knew I'd lost my fear instead

And to think that I said
Love was for fools
And that time would never heal
These old wounds
But the nightingale saved a prayer for me

In the twilight, he played a faithful true
I have heard the lark over the vale
And I've heard the lonesome whippoorwill
But the sweetest song is the nightingale's
And I know I'll never get my fill

And to think that I said love for fools and that time would never heal these old wounds
But the nightingale saved a prayer for me
In the twilight, he played a faithful tune

Living now, here but for fortune
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

Arise sweet destiny, time runs short
All of your patience has heard their retort
Hear us now, for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

Can you hear the words being whispered
All along the American stream
Tyrants freed, the just are imprisoned
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

Ah but perhaps too much
Is being asked of too few
You and your children with nothing to do
Hear us now, for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dream

I had a dream, woke up shaking
The moon breaking through the tress
And in the stillness of the evening
I heard a rustling in the leaves
And I saw a panther in the yard
Moving slow across the ledge
With silver eyes and a cool regard
And hunger with a cutting edge

Open the door, let it in
This mystery you found
It's all yours now
Come lay the panther down

So I called the eagle and the raven said
My prayer to the sky with the moon as my witness
I looked the panther in the eye and beheld
His violent beauty
That cut so deep and hard
Through my civilized indifference
And reckless disregard

So I open the door and let it in
This mystery I found is all mine now
Time to lay the panther down

Generation X is doin' fine

Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

These sore red eyes explore the room again.
The signed pictures of film stars who stayed here in eras
 that knew of no wall.
Berlin...Berlin... Berlin...Berlin...
Part of the old world lives
On this island in Germany
And still out there through the window at six in the
morning. The essence survives.
Berlin...Berlin... Berlin...Berlin...
Come they told me, down to the dark clubs at night
They'll surprise you , the one's who are asleep when it's light
So outrangeous, like tropical birds in a cage
Out from underneath their stones.
Berlin...Berlin... Berlin...Berlin...
Berlin...Berlin... Berlin...Berlin...
Young faces new ideals, in search of paradise
They merge into the history, the theatre of memories
 that make up the feel of
Berlin...Berlin... Berlin...Berlin...

Will I ever find the girl on my mind,
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream, and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me.
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal.

Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognise the light in his eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognise the light in his eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Although he may be late
I trust in fate, and so I wait for my ideal
I wait for my ideal

Will I ever find the girl on my mind, the one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream, and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

When you see my silhouette on the peak of the roof,
Disturbance down aloof(???), straining my eyes for the Northern Lights.
Pulling down stars out of our doors and from our heads.

There is no proof that this is real,
So I'm out back inventing the wheel.
Your love at any price I'd steal.

I wanna cut your Christmas tree,
Drag it through the snow,
Leave it at your knees.

The heart's a muscle,
I pull it constantly.
Pull my muscles
Pull my muscles, please.

And now I've built everything you own.
You know I live to break my bones.
But you've run out of little tasks,
So take this planet off your back,
And let's call this star home.

Cover my ears before they freeze.
I'm dragging through the snow,
Falling at your knees.

The heart's a muscle,
I pull it constantly.
Pull my muscles
Pull my muscles, please.

You gave my shirt back
I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong
I've been told but I don't really like the feeling
I've been away, I've been away too long

I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out
Make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

Wake up moon we spend the night alone together
You're a real good listener, but you don't have much to say
Wake up you, you won't pick up the phone whatever
You're probably sleeping, I hope we're still okay

I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out
Make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass

Your heart is a muscle

Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

I read the news every day or I try
Switch back and forth between
A scowl and a smile
People lift me up or drop me
Flat like a stone
But still I want to believe in them
My clan comes number one in the fight
We brought souls in this world
And we'll do it right
Though my moods they swing like a pendulum
They know where my heart comes from
Like our dear departed friend Andy told me
It's only water off a ducks
Back in the stream
Face it like a man face it like a wimp
But either way you're facing it

Burying your hero underneath
Your feathers
Signals a swan song
Yes the ride is short but your
Heretage is long

Muscle memory
Is what I use to carry me
Muscle memory
Ain't no way I worry 'bout a thing
Muscle memory
I reference stuff I know
Muscle memory
Then put my feet down and go

I want music to bring me down to my knees
Make me sob like an infant make me angry
Rip me to shreds clue me back up
Make my mind explode
Things that matter I can afford
Get my shit together and get onboard
Shed every pound, melt it away
Rid that overweight load

Burying your head underneath the sand
Is succumbing to the words I can't
Ok the ride may stall but your legacy
Stands tall

Muscle memory
Is what I use to carry me
Muscle memory
Ain't no way I worry 'bout anything
Muscle memory
I reference stuff I learn
Muscle memory
Disfigurement I've earned

And I wear it like a badge of honor
No stone unturned
Yeah it's the bane of my existence
To pass the torch in a world of nonsense

Shot a miss
So many nights I've toiled over this
Once around
Crotchety young man make it count

I make my own news out on the fly
Do much more than I need to get by
People lift me up
Don't let me drop
Or at least have a net there

Burying your hero in your hands
Looks like a deserted plan
Yes the ride is short
With temptations to abort
ok the ride may stall
You still sound off the bugle call

Muscle memory
Is what I use to carry me
Muscle memory
Ain't no way I worry 'bout anything
Muscle memory
I reference stuff I know
Muscle memory
Then put me feet down and go

And I go, yeah
There I go

lay float on my back
pull my feet off the ground
let my head hit the sack

i'm muscle in plastic
nyjinski's bad move
just a white show piece
i've got nothing to lose

i preach for the praise
can't laugh so i gaze
like a bad offset
i'm just counting the days

i'm muscle in plastic
nyjinski's bad move
just a white show piece
i've got nothing, nothing to lose

sonar blips on my arms
my head's increased
just a hotel inmate
i'm the lover deceased
i'm the latent impression of a dancer's leg
i like faking persuasion
and laying my bed

i'm muscle in plastic
nyjinski's bad move

Muscle Cars, yay!

[Chorus]

Not out of the local news paper, but out the AutoTrader
Cleaner, than virgin cuchie, my nigga, one on her Cutlass, player
The beat wrapped in monster cables, the speaker's thumping
Trunk sounding like Godzilla, and King Kong, back there thumping
All we do is wic, and get high and pedal and push!
Organic weed, mystery weed, just purple cush!
I cut the rear weld, on my whip, and filled that bitch up
And now muscle car sitting up high like a monster truck
Monster up, suck up to none, don't be no poodle
Split his pack open like pack of Top Ramen noodle
In the heart of the soil, where you can find me
Try me fuck boy and get your face put on a white tee
40, Turf Talk and Keak the Sneak
They mayne ass voices, and they styles is hekka unique
High speed chase's and running lights
Water in the duals, make loud glass pipes

[Chorus]

Four barrel carburetor, four speed trany
Dual exhaust dipped in sauce
My car is a beast, catch me in the streets side ways
Threw the East Side-Boy, crunk like Lil' Jon
Show 40, and Mac Keak the last don
East Oakland the land of the side show
Richmond, Frisco, to the Valley Jo
I'm riding side ways, this way and that way
Door's open, while in traffic
Hold the door open (Hello!)
Shitting on 'em, no fronting
455 got me running up on Aston Martins
We run from them on streets, not the freeway
B&M shift kit (kik) me and Danny Phea
On my celly cell straight lace with no fucking dew
Mobbing in my ol' school, like Lil' Bruce

[Chorus]

Four 15's, beat supreme
Told niggas fuck Rally's, ride gold one's mayne
Mother's off candid, don't hate 'cause I ain't me
Race, foo, smoke in your face, foo
Super charger, push this button and my engine start up
Pistol tucked
Might be premiered, but my engine souped up
Quick to the floor when you open yours
Don't scratch my doors. 350 I push heavy
Not a Ford it's (Chevy, Chevy, Chevy)
First owner, not too many miles on her
We rep the BAY, we don't rep California (I'm liyin')
I'm run you for your car note
Why you don't got S-S's in front of your Monte Carlo?
Residence full of white folks
I'm leave fresh tire marks top of they asphalt

You got muscle car? You fucking with them Muscle cars?

[Chorus]

She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time
So look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little much too late

Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
And begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
Yeah, and I'll do it on my own

I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
And begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
Yeah, and I'll do it on my own
And I'll do it all by myself
You will never make it

I am your shadow
I am your rain
I am your longing
A little of your pain
I am red
I am blue
I am your angel
I am in you

Angel
Angel

I am your madness
I am your tears
I am your sadness
And I am your fears
I am restless
I am your dreams
I am the moments
In between

Angel

Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel baby

Clouds just disappear

All the things I've done before this - they don't mean a thing
And all the words spoken before this won't be said again
Suddenly so much of me has no need to pretend
There's nothin' like the truth to bring her back to you
And everyone I've met before this ain't seen me with you

Angel, angel, angel
Angel, my angel, my angel

You're the only one who knows what I go through
Sometimes you even feel it more than me, baby
And I don't know how I ever got by without you
There's nothing like the truth when you've got nothin' left to lose
And every night I thank the universe that I found you

Angel, my angel, my angel

And I don't have to wonder what the world thinks about me
I know you're in my corner
Ooo, you're always surrounding me with your love, baby

Oh, angel, ooo

And if we all explode
You see, we would never know
But I just hope the pieces of my soul reach out to you
To find my angel, ooo, angel, my angel

Angel, my angel, my angel, ooo

Angel, my darlin' angel
Callin' me, oh angel
Keep callin' me, ooo
Angel

Angel, ooo

Ooo

I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me

When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart

You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

Life is just a moment
We're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us
If win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us

When there's darkness all around me
You're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind

You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

You're my angel (my angel)
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, my miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

You're all I need to know (angel), (angel), (angel)
You're angel (angel), (my angel)
My angel my, my, my angel (angel), (my angel), (my angel)

They say he doesn't love me but they don't know
He makes me feel so happy when I'm feeling low
My friends just can't seem to see
That he means the world to me

And that he's mine and I adore him
(He's everything everything to me)
Oh I adore him
(He's all that a boy that a boy can be)
Yes I adore him

But sometimes when I cry at night
He makes things turn out alright

And that he's mine and I adore him
(He's everything everything to me)
Oh I adore him
(He's all that a boy that a boy can be)
Yes I adore him

When we walk hand in hand through the land
I never feel afraid
Knowing he's around
They say he's cheating on me
But I don't care
'Cause when I need his loving
He's always there
I can't help but wonder why
I've been blessed with such a guy
And that he's mine I adore him

[Repeat To Fade]

The light grows dim and my breath escapes,
Now the journey begins.
To release my soul into your hands,
Is this the final sin?

One last breath to say yes or no,
I must make a choice.
The hands of fate are around my neck
Ready to steal my voice.

Fallen Angel (Fallen Angel)
Falling down.....
Fallen Angel (Fallen Angel)
Just let me Drown....

Into the darkness in another world,
This is where I would stay.
A Fallen angel in another realm
Just tryin' to find a way.

I close my eyes but I'm not alone,
My spirit forms within.
Inside my mind I could never grow old,
Is this my final sin?

Fallen Angel (Fallen Angel)
Falling down.....
Fallen Angel (Fallen Angel)
Just let me Drown....

Fallen Angel (Fallen Angel)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
If I could I'd give you the world
Wrap it all around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of this heart

My angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Dreams are dreams, some dreams come true
I found a real dream, baby, when I found you
You're so strong, but tender too

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Love like ours is Heaven-sent
Each day a day to remember
I feel so safe, feel secure with you

You give me love, you keep right on giving
Fill me up, baby, with the joy of living
When things get tough I can always turn to you

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel

Love the way we touch, I love the way it feels
Every time you're near me my poor heart just won't keep still
No doubt about that this love I feel is real
Ask me to go with you, you know I will

Hold me near, hold me tight
Only you can make it real, only you make it all right
Just let me know that I am special to you

My angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

He went away and you hung around
And bothered me, every night
And when I wouldn't go out with you
You said things that weren't very nice

My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)

(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)

(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
Because he knows I've been true now

Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get to somewhere

Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain cause I'm so guarded
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear

And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there...
Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel?

Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone sings

But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there

Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please send me an angel
Can you send me an angel?

First angel says "Go on and love her"
Second angels says "Ain't you tired of being alone?"
Third angel says "Do the right thing, meat"
Fourth angels says "Check that other little angel walkin' on down the street"

They're all telling me what to do

Love's waitin' 'round the corner for you, son"

It don't take long for the good to get gone"
Walkin' on wings all sexy and blue
Seventh angel says I'm a fool
I got seven angels calling on my pride
Seven devils crawling around inside
Seven angels tellin' me which way to turn
One kiss and my soul wanna burn

Seven angels got my number
They're all telling me what to do
The earth's so lonely, sad and blue
And without love, your soul's dyin'
Sixth angel says to believe you
When you say you'll never leave me cryin'
Seventh angel says you're lyin'

"Take this man to prison," the man heard herod say,
And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away.
Chained up between two watchmen, peter tried to sleep,
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep.
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,
And running to his people before the break of day,

Angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,
Angels watching over me!

God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.

Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angles watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,
Angels watching over me

Angels watching over me
Angels watching over me

Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,
Angels watching over me!

Angels watching over me,
Angels watching over me,
Angels watching over me,
Angels watching over me!

Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home

I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me

When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart

You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

Life is just a moment
We're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us
If win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us

When I need someone to ease my troubled mind

You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere

Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

Now is an angel there?
Now is an angel there?
Now is an angel there?

One left out
When they passed heaven about
What about me
Sitting here in my purgatory
So left out
He's dead
I'm alive
He's spared
Always an angel who cares
Always an angel there

One like me
We try so hard
Five like you
Someone dead again
Where's your angel now?
Where's your angel now?
Where's your morals now?
Where's your morals?

Always an angel there
Where's your angel now?
Always an angel who cares
Always an angel there
Where's your morals?
There's always an angel who cares
There's always an angel there

No more people staring
No more fatal dares
Like a baby grabbing at
Something that isn't there
But it is
But it is

Always an angel there
Always an angel who cares
Always an angel there
Always an angel who cares

The angel rides with hunchbacked children, poison oozing from his engine
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven
Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked
The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires stroke his precious pavement

The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards
Dragging great anchors, followin' dead-end signs into the sores
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore

Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
She rubs against the weatherbeaten frame and asks the angel for his name
Off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands, with a naked feel off into parts unknown
The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones

Through danger seen and unseen
There's protection all around
Under the refuge of God's wings
Security is found
For there are angels watchin you to keep you in all of your ways
Keeping you from stumbling so don't be afraid
God's appointed angels watching over me angels watchin over me

Angel watching over me
Angel watching over me

Unseen hands guiding me
Though my storm and through my rain
Healing hands holding me
Through the darkness of my pain
Wings of loving hands
Around me so I will not fear
For I can feel the presence covering me
Nothing but angels watching over me
Angels watching over me

Angel watching over me
Angel watching over me

All night
All day

Me my lord

Tryin to score, tryin to make a pass
Anything at all, don't have to last

With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts
Dyin' aint the s***

To the rhythm of my love for you,
And now it's beating slow, and you know

And I would hide it in my hopeless soul

And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)

When the angels call like (i answer)

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday,
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said "fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Sure enough this morning came on to me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said on to
"Today is the day for you to rise,
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man,
You're gonna rise"
And she took me high over yonder

And I said "fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Forever I will be by your side"

Far above the highest heavens
On a throne of crystal light
Dwells the God of all creation
Rays of wonder crown His might
Human voices blend with the angels
Giving praise to God alone
Heavens music rises upward
To the Lamb upon the throne
To the Lamb upon the throne

[Chorus]
Blessing! Glory! Sing Hallelujah!
Shout the saints of God alone
Honor! Power! and Dominion!
Praises gather at the throne
Oh, they gather at the crystal throne
Gather at the crystal throne

Lightning flashes and thunder echoes
Diamond rainbows fill the sky
Awesome beauty God's provision
Never seen by human eye
Blazing colors show the glory
Of the Master Artist's plan
Built by god for those who love Him
Those who trust the great "I am"
Those who trust the great "I am"

[Chorus]

Welcome to the Throne Room
Welcome to the place where it all got started
Bow down in His presence and worship Him

Welcome to the Throne Room
Beyond the veil only those who know and love Him
Come boldly before His throne

And cry holy, holy, holy, holy
Cry out holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
Which was, and is, and is to come

Welcome to the Throne Room
Welcome to the place where He shows His face
Oh, worship in spirit and in truth

Welcome to the Throne Room
Welcome to the place where it all got started
Bow down (bow down)

And cry holy, holy, holy, holy
Cry out holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
Which was, and is, and is to come

Welcome to the Throne Room

Get him off the throne
Moreover he's not in control no longer
The King will come, it's over
The game goes on

Someone's waiting on the other side
Trying to get over

Got to be in this hour

There on the other side
We know that someone keeps waiting

Don't you know your enemy?
Don't you know you're damned?

Release the beast
Set it free
I've come to tell you once more
Don't let him break this seal
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
We must serve the fire

Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope
Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope

Curse the wind
A storm from the north
Comes to divide us
Will deny us
To break your king

These were dark lands
In a dead world
Rearranged
We brought it into light
A union of the land and king

It's a new world
It is new land
But it ends here
In the here and now
Another failure once again

We will not believe in any word you may say
We will not believe in any word you may say

Now we can see the enemy
I've come to tell you once more
It's me, I hold the key
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

Curse them all
They'll tear down the wall
Come to divide us
They'll defy us
Take my throne

All I am is nothing else
What you have made me
Nothing more I am
Your vision of another god
All I know is they won't give
But they will take
Your sacred light away
And still they come to praise the damned

Can't you see?
It's your innocence they'll steal away
Yes, they're coming for you
They've come to deceive
You are betrayed
You admire these liars
They'll never fool me

We will not surrender
We won't take it no more
We will not surrender
We won't take it anymore

We'll break the seal and set 'em free
I've come to tell you once more
As I will now reveal
But let me tell you once more
Peace is gone

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

Determination
Blame the light
Blame the night
Day and night
Black and white

Take a look at yourself
There is nothing to fear no more
There is nothing to fear no more

She's my Queen
I'm her King man
No love no deh like the
Love I bring her

While I'm waking
Waiting for me

Behold how good and pleasant it is

Beauty, beauty, beauty
Moves with grace and full of love
Shining like the stars above
She's my Queen, she's my Queen,
She's my Queen

Before the throne of grace I come
Humble and repentant one
With sorrow for the deeds I've done
Before the throne of grace I come

Before the throne of grace I fall
With a trembling voice I call
For pardon from the Lord of all
Before the throne of grace I fall
I love the Lamb Who took my sin
Whose Mercy makes me clean again

Before the throne of grace I hear
Your debt is paid your name is clear
Such precious words of life so dear
Before the throne of grace I hear
I love the Lamb Who took my sin
Whose Mercy makes me clean again
I rise with words of grateful praise
Knowing now the only way

Before the throne of grace I stand
Is all because the Son of Man
Bears my wounds in His Feet and Hands
So before the throne of grace I stand
Before the throne of grace I stand

It is though God by command has withdrawn every other throne.
And God is saying, no.
These people will deal with me alone.

Paralyse the actions of the weak
Force fed propaganda preying on the meek
Individuals resisting defeat
Manipulate the colonies, infected by their seed

Vampires of possession
Shroud of cold distrust
Watching as you finally fall
Then drag you through the dust
The only way to save your soul
From scum with hearts of stone

Reconquering the throne

Parasites have drained you from your mind
Anesthisize your conscience infliction will take time
Fools once trusted, guilty of the crime
Suck deep upon your energy, delusions lead the blind

Our rising has begun

A million hearts
Not alone
Light the spark
Storm the throne

Where's the muses cave
The isle of the dead
The sign of Eph is gone
So is the sun

Tired and confused
I sail into the night
With the devil at my shoulder
I'll be fine

I ride the straits of darkness everyday
No light will lead my way from my pain
Drowned in tideless pools
No haven for my mind
In grief I meet the storm
Eye to eye

On the ebony throne
Lies the diagonstone
My voyage to vanity
Oh, take me there

To the ebony throne
I followed the sirensong
No enlightened society
Can bring me back

In the maelstrom of minds
Like a will-o-the-wisp
I sail on...

I sail the depths of apathy alone
The world is fading
I'm a long way from home

Once prayed to my gods, searching for the whistled memories
Empty eyes are staring now, to my feet a land of sorrow
I'm the king, sitting in the dark hiding from the shadows of the wind
Wafts of might, wine of fire, I was called to taste

Silver horses brought us here, to the edge of the universe
We left the falling walls as the stars' collapse began
Now I rest on the highest steps, revealed the eternal frontier
As I gaze from the Jewel Throne to the portal of infinity

Fallen have the "chosen ones", debris remain in the dust
Far behind, beyond the sands, the wind sings to those who fell
Forever now, my hands laid down the poisoned weapons
I will pray to my gods, searching for the mysteries

Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you

Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know

Picture if you will, that the thrones burning
Romes burning and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for
That I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead
But I'm sorry but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July fourth
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over,
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So the love is gone, 'til blood is drawn
So we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you

Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces, before you swept on it
God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
Shit feelin' like death don't it
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasn't I a good king?
(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
Made you Royalty and royalties
(Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
And this is how niggas rewardin' me
(Damn)

Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
Ooh
I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know

Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
And I'm bussin' back, so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turns the hate?
(Gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes)
Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to assist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brother's keeper?
(Only if that nigga don't creep up)
Got a pistol under my pillow
(I've never been a deep sleeper)
P-p-p-paranoia
(Cause the nigga that said he'll)
Blast for ya (Is now)
Blastin' for ya, that's an assassin for ya
(These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
Please lord (Forgive him)
For these niggas (Not know)
What they, (Do) (Ooh)

What kind of King would leave His throne
In Heaven to make this earth His home?
While men seek fame and great renown
In lowliness our King comes down

Jesus, Jesus, precious one
How we thank You that You've come
Jesus, Jesus, precious one
A manger throne for God's own son

You left the sound of angels' praise
To come for men with unkind ways
And by this Baby's helplessness
The power of nations is laid to rest

Jesus, Jesus, precious one
How we thank You that You've come
Jesus, Jesus, precious one
A manger throne for God's own son

I was looking in the mirror
Trying to find, a new reflection
Wanna take the road, less traveled in
A different direction
Make some new mistakes
Forget the ones I made
Cry some tears of joy
And dress more like a boy

And come back as a blonde
Try a different lipstick on, as a blonde

I'd be ever so enticing
Eat a lot of icing
Never have to watch my weight
Yeah when I'm gone
I'm gonna come back as a blonde

I wanna I meet myself, as someone else
Just to see what it feels like
Take a walk, on the other side
Cause you know that I just might
Break some different hearts, finish what I start
I'm not gonna wait, to mess around with fate

Hey, I think you got my number
When I was out with my brother
You said 'hi' and I think I liked you
Oh we talked about maybe getting together
A raincheck on the weather
Cloudy skies and I had to get home
Oh those eyes
I thought you were a really nice guy
I thought you were just my type
But I forgot your name

I'm a blonde so excuse me

And everybody knows
We're a little more than fun

Hey I'm not a college grad yet
There are some books I haven't read yet
But I could quote
A little bit of shakespeare in my sleep
But there have been those times
When I've clearly forgotten
How to spell words like R-E-E-D-I-N-G
Me, me and myself
And I try really hard to get by
With simple little things

I'm a blonde so excuse me
I'm a blonde I get crazy
And everybody knows
We're a little more than fun
I like to play it up like I'm dumb

Maybe I could try to change up their minds
So they take me serious

Everybody knows that I'm not dumb

She knew it would finish before it began
Woah baby, you lost the plan

You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde

Stripped to the beat but her clothes stay on
White light everywhere but you can't see a thing
Such a squeeze a mad sad moment
Glory to you, glory to you take me there, take me there, oh

Got some revelation put into your hands
Save you from your misery like rain across the land
Don't you see the color of deception?
Turnin' your world around again

You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde

You wanna make, you wanna make
You wanna make her, suicide blonde
You wanna make

That's the story
Everything you wanna be
Everything you are, are

You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde, no
You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde, yeah

Love devastation
You wanna make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her

A perfect face comes calling
A perfect hand reaches out
Her perfect face in the morning
December girl feels the same
She needs to find a place
Cause she never looked so good when she was down

She's blonde on white
White on blonde
Her perfections are now gone
Reflections everywhere
If you gaze for too long
It will fade and then it's gone
Reflections everywhere

Imagine naked legs falling
Walking barefoot in the rain
Imagine freezing cold weather
December girl feels the same
She needs to find a place
Cause she never looked so good when she was down

She's blonde on white
White on blonde
Her perfections are now gone
Reflections everywhere
If you gaze for too long
It will fade and then it's gone
Reflections everywhere

A perfect face comes calling

I'm just some name in your book
That's why you gave up writing weeks ago
You won't be getting in touch
Oh do you ever?
And I meant every word that I said
Oh did I try to hard oh, I don't know
You made sure it wouldn't happen again
Oh you're clever!
Yes I was that naive
Yes I was that naive
You've heard this all before
You've heard this all before
I'm just some name in your book
That's why you gave up writing weeks ago
You won't be getting in touch
Oh do you ever?
Yes I was that naive
Yes I was that naive
You've heard this all before
You've heard this all before
I still can't believe
I still can't believe
That's all you took me for
That's all you took me for

Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
How can I explain
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, Jeez, I can't find my knees
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him
But like Louise always says
You can't look at much, can ya man
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain

A fire's beneath the cloak of night has our minds in control
We guard them with our weary eyes and we watch them grow
When the time is right
And we're ready to begin
At the first tide, your patience wearing thin
Scattered in from night
I scrawl it in a winter white
Melting into thin air

The kind of which I came to be
Left of being swallowed whole
By offering a piece of me
To any given fool
Scattered in the mud
Like innocent shades of white
Spreading by the wind

(Change goes on)
(Wind blows south)

It doesn't end
They ask us why, who said we had a chance?
Want me to fall?
It doesn't end (through the wind, through the wind)
They ask us why, who said we had a chance?
Want me to fall?

Too thin (through the wind, through the wind)
Too thin, too thin (through the wind, through the wind, through the wind)

(Change goes on)
(Through the wind, through the wind, through the wind)
(Wind blows south)

Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh baby
Ooh baby blue
Ooh babe

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice

Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too.
And the sea may look warm to you babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooooh baby
Ooooh baby blue
Oooooh babe.

Rick and wealthy canvas
Clustered up in jewels
Finding all your heavyweights
Are featherweights and fools

Broken all your promises
Broken all your paper plates
Clustered in gold
Crusted in gold

Heavy and hollow
Look at the shape we're in
Find us here
Paper thin
Heavy and humble
Look at the shape we're in
Find us here
Paper thin

In origami cities
In nations built on sand
Love got bent right outta shape
Things got outta hand

Polystyrene skylines
Papier mache smiles
Rusted and bruised
Tarnished and frail

Heavy and hollow
Look at the shape we're in
Find us here
Paper thin
Heavy and humble
Look at the shape we're in
Find us here
Paper thin, paper thin, paper thin...

Stars scrape the moon
And the moon scrapes the sky
We stand beneath
Wondering why

Stars scrape the moon
And the moon scrapes the sky
We stand beneath
Wondering why, wondering why

Paper buys the men
The men that make to bomb
The bomb that makes this world
Paper thin!

Money markets crumble
Gentle as a drum
But if you see me stumble, I'm
Paper thin!

Life is but a fragile thing
So delicate and pure
An accolade bestowed on us
Paper thin

So contemplate the skull
The skull beneath the skin
One day we all die, we're
Paper thin!

Bury your destruction
In your last battle hymn
The barriers between us, make 'em all
Paper thin! Paper thin!
Paper thin! Paper thin!

Underneath the paper moon
The sky is paper thin
Torn into a thousand shreds
So let the solar system in

Rick and wealthy canvas
Clustered up in jewels
Finding all your heavyweights
Are featherweights and fools

In origami cities
In nations built on sand
Love got bent right outta shape
Nothing ends as planned

And it's all - Paper thin
Paper thin. Paper thin

Now that you've grown up
You can finally learn to be a child
We made it to the end of the world
But we'll never make it out alive

Skin thin
I breathe out, you breathe in
But the days seem so long
Skin thin, blood again
It's all I can do to hold on
We're just skin thin

Always knew if we didn't have each other
We'd have nothing at all
And you were always brave enough
To live like you could never fall

Skin thin
I breathe out, you breathe in
But the days seem so long
Skin thin, blood again
It's all I can do to hold on

Now that we've grown up
Can finally learn to be a child
With good friends behind me
But ghosts up ahead for miles and miles

Skin thin
I breathe out, you breathe in
But the days they seem so long
Skin thin, blood again
It's all I can do to hold on
Life's just skin thin

Now that you've grown up
You can finally learn to be a child
We made it to the end of the world
But we'll never make it out alive

We'd have nothing at all

The sound is on the visions move
The image dance starts once again
They shuffle with a bovine grace and glide in syncopation
Just living lines from books we've read
With atmospheres of days gone by
With paper smiles
The screenplay calls a message for the nation

And those who sneer will fade and die
And those who laugh will surely fall
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall
The thin wall
Thin wall

Grey men who speak of victory
Shed light upon their stolen life
They drive by night and act as if they're moved by unheard music
To step in time and play the part
With velvet voices smooth and cold
Their power games a game no more
And long the chance to use it

(Chorus)

And those who dance will spin and turn
And those who wait will wait no more
And those talk will hear the word
And those who sneer will fade and die
And those who laugh will surely fall
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall
The thin wall
Thin wall

The thin wall (Repeat 3 times)

And those who dance
The thin wall
And those who talk
The thin wall
And those who sneer
The thin wall
And those who laugh
The thin wall
And those who know
The thin wall
And those who dance
The thin wall
And those who wait
The thin wall
And those who talk
(Fade)

(Written by Lindsey Buckingham)

I seen so many things that make me wonder
But sometimes it's hard to tell
I said, "Take your time"
But no one was listenin'
I walk a thin line

They told me that I never would recover
Still some say they knew me well
I said "Stay by my side"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

And I said "Please toe the line"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

And I said "Fate takes time"
But no one was listenin'
I walk a thin line

This house used to feel so warm
The heater works but I'm chilled to the bone
Oh, this room never felt so big
There's not enough conversation to fill the empty spaces
Now how can you love someone and not know them at all?

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside

I talked, you used to hear me so well
Now all the best conversations are with myself
Oh I wish I knew what's pullin' you away
But the space that's grown between us gets a little bigger everyday
How can you love someone and not know them at all?

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise, oh yea
It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise, yea
It's a thin disguise, yea yea

That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned
That any time I've wandered I always have returned

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Says Bill, "The air is clean tonight", as he puffs a big cigar
"And if this rig keeps rolling, my boy you'll travel far
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by"

In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again
That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

[Chorus]
I don't want to know. And I don't want to see you in this place.
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face.
And I don't want to hear anymore.
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor.

Get the fuck out of here now.
Come on you kids, stand your ground.
This is your show, it's your family.
All of my friends there for me.
There's four-hundred more of us then them.
So kick them out.
Keep it positive.
Keep it real. Keep it true.
Together with my friends.
I'll be there for you.

Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
This is to my brothers, I ll be there for you.
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
This is to my family, I'll be there for you.

[Chorus]

I was gonna get up off that bar stool
Just as soon as I could figure it out
Why I was overlooked at the car pool
Stood up at the dance with no twist and shout

When you're burnin' with your last desire
And every memory haunts you
You write it down in alcohol fire
'Cause that's the only flame that wants you

When you're paper thin
Yeah, read all about it
When you were out of luck, well, luck was doin' alright
Now you're paper thin
Yeah, they can see right through ya
You just cut you're little finger on the edge of the night

Now do I really have to be responsible
For what I did between those tavern walls
I was just mixing up some chemicals
You could've heard a pin drop, could have heard time crawl

And every once in a while
You could hear you're own heart pound
Maybe some paper doll with a pasted on smile
Would let you write her number down

When you're paper thin
Yeah, read all about it
When you were out of luck, well, luck was doin' alright
Now you're paper thin
Yeah, they can see right through ya
You just cut you're little finger on the edge of the night

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

Today did I forget
To say "I love you", girl (I'm sorry)
Hey, don't scold me yet
I'll prove it a hundred ways (Don't worry)

In this world of ups and downs
Baby, you're the one, the thing I found
You saved me from a place we both had been
Called lonely (Lonely)

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

When things aren't going right
I'll hold you in my arms (Don't worry)
You know you make me cry
If ever I let you down (I'm sorry)

Well I'm going to prove my love to you
Each day that I live my life with you
Through good and bad weather
We're together (Together)

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

Ooh, baby (Through thick and thin)
I will always love you, yeah, yeah
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you, yeah
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you, ooh baby
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

Love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
Love is thin ice
So you better know how to swim

If you're not ready for fallin'
Then you better be careful when love starts callin'
Take my advice
Love is thin ice

You'd better watch your step it's hard to read the signs
And some times you have to lose before you can find
They say, "All in love is fair"
You got to give for someone to care
And it can be so nice but love is thin ice

Love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
Love is thin ice
So you better know how to swim

If you're not ready for fallin'
Then you better be careful when love starts callin'
Take my advice
Love is thin ice

You'd better stick to higher ground if you don't want to cry
But if you don't take a chance you'll never learn how to fly
One day you're walkin' on air
Next thing you know your heart needs repair
But that's just the price 'cause love is thin ice

Love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
Love is thin ice
So you better know how to swim

If you're not ready for fallin'
Then you better be careful when love starts callin'
Take my advice
Love is thin ice

You better take my advice
Love is thin ice

A million baby kisses
From a kissing booth on wheels
This sign is pretty poison
On the envelope she seals
And your love is by the way
Who knows exactly how she feels
Whose torture
Without you, it's torture
What new

You climb into your rocket ship
And count from ten to one
There's no television coverage
For that loser on the run
You hide yourself in darkness
But we're heading for the sun

Whose torture
Torture ooh
Without you, yeah torture
Torture ooh
What to do, it's torture
Torture ooh
Without you, it's torture
Torture ooh
Tighter and tighter and tighter soon
Yeah torture

An 809 is rockin'
With a party full of lies
And on the tenth floor smokin'
Till the sun's about to rise
There's trouble in 302
Can't you see it in my eyes

Whose torture
Torture ooh
Without you really torture
Torture ooh
What to do, it's torture
Torture ooh
Without you it's torture
Whose torture

I'm in the room without a light
The room without a view
I'm here for one more treacherous night
Another night with you
It tortures me to move my hands
To try to move at all
And pulled
My skin so tight it screams
And screams and screams
And pulls some more
Hanging like this
Like a vampire bat
Hanging like this
Hanging on your back
I'm helpless again

My body is cut and broken
It's shattered and sore
My body is cut wide open
I can't stand anymore
It tortures me to move my hands
To try to move at all
And pulled
My skin so tight screams
And screams and screams
And screams some more

Hanging like this
Like a vampire bat
Hanging like this hanging on your back
Oh it's torture
And I'm almost there
It's torture
But I'm almost there

It's torture
But I'm almost there
It's torture
But I'm almost there

It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters

She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming

Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, start the flame in me

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

She said reality is a knife

Baby, because you cut me like a knife without your love in my life.
I'm out, I'm walkin' the night 'cause I just can't stop this feelin'.
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture.
She was up a stair to nowhere.
A room forever I'll remember.
She said as though I should have known her,

Every little thing you find here is simply for the thrill you're after.
Loneliness or hearts on fire.

Unmerciful is the night when you just can't stop this feelin'.
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture.

It's torture, it's torture, it's torture.

It's like torture
I can't say no and that's no lie
It's torture
Get closer
I bite my lip and burn so cold
Closer
Tell myself
Yeah, I'm all you need
I tell myself
Yeah, I'm all you need
It's like torture
Yeah, that's no lie
It's like torture
Temptation
I can't say no and that's no lie
Temptation
Is pulling strings
And telling lies
It's torture
It's like torture
There's nothing in between the lines
It's torture
Tell myself
Yeah, I'm all you need
I tell myself
Yeah, I'm all you need
It's like torture
Yeah, that's no lie
It's like torture
It's anything that satisfies
It's temptation
Temptation
Torture it's like torture
Temptation
Anyway you want
It's torture
Temptation
Knocking down my door
It's torture
Temptation
Anyway you want
It's torture
Temptation
Knocking down my door
It's torture

Touch me, hold me, whirl away
Silence, sadness, white and grey

Torture, torture, twisted love
Kiss me, kick me, feel my blood

Forever, for now, my heart screams for you
Desperate memories, broken and true
Living for tears now, I'm dying for love

Merging and fading, forgiving again
Torture, torture, torture

Pain is my reward from psychotic tendencies
Pain I give to you
Pain relentlessly
Torturing has reached a level no one's ever seen
Suffer for your life
Rabid force extreme
Rage is my obsession driven by my cruelty
Rage is my release
Rage relentlessly
Ravaging continues through my scattered lunacy
Malice for your life
Rapid force extreme

Demented aggression

Hate is the reason I embrace these fantasies
Hate engulfs my mind
Hate relentlessly
With pain and rage and hatred relentlessly

[Repeat x2]
With pain
Rage and hate
Beatings come faster
Beatings last longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Beatings are forever
I don't think you'll live

Don't think you'll live
Don't think you'll live
I don't think you'll live

Pain is my reward from psychotic tendencies
Rage is my release
Hate relentlessly
With pain and rage and hatred relentlessly

[Repeat x2]
With pain
Rage and hate
Torture coming faster
Torture lasting longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Torture is forever
I don't think you'll live

Don't think you'll live
Don't think you'll live
I don't think you'll live

Left as a pummeled mound of waste
Rot and decay under the sun

[Repeat x2]
With pain
Rage and hate
Suffering is faster
Suffering is longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Suffering is forever
I don't think you'll live

Torture!
Ripping nails, water boarding,
Electric shock
Crucified, brutalized,
Left to die
Interrogation, humiliation,
Cut off tongue
Isolation, desperation, die alone
Torture.
Motherfucking torture
Torture
Motherfucking torture

Eye lids cut, limbs are gone,
Separation
High voltage on your head,
Hallucination
Scarface, scarhead, mutilation
Extreme agony sets you free

Torture.
Motherfucking torture
Torture
Motherfucking torture

Abducted by a psychopath with evil intent
Beaten to the point of unconsciousness
Awakened by the sound of someone screaming in pain

Realizing now that you are trapped in a cage
Arms and legs in disarray
Bones have all been broken and your limbs are displaced
Body in a horrible state
Unbearable effluvium polluting the air
A nauseating stench of death
Maggots are all over on the walls and the floor
Patiently awaiting for - your flesh

Numerous victims litter the room
You are not the only one
Various forms of torture
Profaned existence for you all

Strapped to tables - chained to the walls
Fingers are reaching out between floorboards
Others are floating in the air held up by hooks
Drained of their lives

Caged, contorted
Caged, contorted

Realizing now that you will die in this place
Emaciating skin awaits
For the maggots that will crawl onto your body and face
The final phase of your demise

Paralyzing agony has left you for dead
The psychopath returns to finish the task
Dying to the sound of others creaming in pain

Caged, contorted
Caged, contorted

There's an evil in your brain
Driving you fucking insane

The evil in your brain
At any cost
To release you from this pain
Death will come

Anybody from deep inside
Torture

There's an evil in your brain
Driving you fucking insane

Torture, torture
Baby, you're torturing me
Why do you lead me around
And make me chase ya

When I catch ya,
You won't let me embrace ya
Please baby, have a heart
'Cause can't you see

You're torturing me
Torturing me
This torture that I'm going through
Is worth the pain if I have you

So, if you love me, let me know
But if you don't , please let me go
Torture, torture
Baby, you're torturing me

You know that I'm crazy about you
Yet you make me do without you
Do you mean to hurt, or don't you see
You're torturing me, torturing me

Creeping in the shadows
Shadows of the night
Wading through the darkness
A death before the light
Blending in with faces
Faces of the night
Safe at home in comfort
At home is where you'll die

Watching you
Knowing your every move
Hearing you
Every single word that you spew
Carving you
Is what I'm about to do
Saving you
From the torment of this earth to be buried for rebirth

Silently I enter through the broken basement window now to wait
It's twelve o'clock the time has come ascend the staircase to the hunted one
Make way to the second floor right outside your open bedroom door
One last time to sleep in peace unaware of brutal things that

Will be done
To you after you awake
Enter slow
Machete leads the way
Eerie calm
Death is in the air
Savage thrust
Death is everywhere

Adrenaline is pumping as my heart is pounding faster yours slows down
Choke on blood and breathe your last breath mangled
Guts I wear to celebrate
Stay inside and fuck the corpse an innards orgy satisfies my needs
Finally I feel complete by eating brains and flesh

Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed

Take what's left in garbage bags and throw them in a hole I dug out back
Clean the room I killed you in making sure the clues of sin are gone
Revel in my vicious deed and replay what had happened in my head
Vivid memories of you remain of your remains

Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed

Followed home then killed

Here they come
No chance of stopping them now
Trudging forward
On a quest - for human flesh
Panic is a catalyst
They crave limbs - to rip and twist
Now soon to be within - their grasp

Run - the chase begins
Terror - they're closing in
Must attempt to refrain from defeat
Done - fallen to the ground
Clawing - disturbing sounds
Can;t escape the gnashing of their teeth

Tearing off the outer skin to invade the inside
Sanguinary mastication now the pain is increased
Slashing of the arteries, completely defiled
Bleeding out and soon to rot - carrion feast

They cannot stop the craving for more blood!!!
They cannot stop the craving for more blood!!!

Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse

Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse

Onward - to feed
Never will the cycle end
Only bones are left behind
Cannot stop this craving for more blood!!!
They cannot stop the craving for more blood!!!

Violently torn through the back of the head as debris from
The skull hits the ground
Writhing and twitching from brains being splattered I'll never get used to that sound
Gaze at the fear in eyes horrified terrified just as a life will expire
Blood drips away from an utter disgrace in hell I will kill you again

Torn through with vengeance o blame
Torn through for wanting you dead

Anger summoned evil deep inside my rotting soul
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control
Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees

Prolonged brutal rampage slaughter with no end in sight
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control

Unforgiving pain is what another death sets free
Sacrifice of sanity accelerates my lack of control

Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees

Killing sprees
Killing sprees
Killing sprees
Killing sprees

Eight more to kill

Five more to kill

Five more to kill
Five more to kill
Four more to kill

Violently torn through the back of the head as debris from
The skull hits the ground
Writhing and twitching from brains being splattered
In hell I will kill you again

Torn through with vengeance to blame
Torn through for wanting you dead

Four more to kill

One more killing spree

Like a virus of the mind
My rage will spread
My obsession with murder
Roils in my head

Killing victims with my hands
I cannot control
These extreme compulsions
Burn in my soul

Foaming at the mouth I leap
Onto my prey
Target of my violence
Will die today

Feel the victim's cracking bones
He screams in pain
Only slaughter brings me peace
I have gone insane

Rabid

Inflammation of the brain
Fury overwhelms
There is something wrong with me
I am not well

Victim's head
Thumbs in his eyes
Blood is squirting from the sockets
Pours down the sides

Smash his teeth with my fist
Tear off his nose
Laughing at his shattered face
Rage only grows
With my fingers gouge his throat
Rip slabs of flesh
I continue the assault
But he is clearly dead

Rabid

Can't restrain my need to kill them drives me mad
I'm insane I want to spill blood with my hands

Schizophrenic mania
Paranoid anxiety
Violent ferocity
Criminal insanity

I am obsessed with butchery I am mad
A trail of corpses so much blood on my hands

Rabid
Rabid

Crucifixion, peasants bound to the cross
Heartless judgement, tyrannical laws
Among the jurists pangs of conscience arise
Conspiracy begins, the crucifier must fall

Assassination was attempted but failed
The conspirators are captured and jailed
Enraged by the plot now he vows his revenge
Hunt them down, seek their death, merciless

Collaborators face a summary trial
They are guilty there can be no denial
Convicted plotters face the hammer and nail
The traitors will be punished, the traitors will die

Their compunction, a sentence of death
Thoughts of mercy are replaced by dread
Punishment for traitors, swift and severe
Kill them all, they will die, crucify

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

Punctured by piercing, the beam dripping blood
As a deterrent they are left there for months
Their agonizing deaths will serve to warn the rest
Betrayers will be hunted, betrayers will die

Wretched traitors, sun cooking their flesh
Rotting slowly they're begging for death
Transfixed by iron only bones will remain
He will hunt, hell's pursuit, execute

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

No remorse for their deaths
No one will be spared from this fate
Hammer spikes through their hands
Penetrate the soles of their feet

Plant the stakes in the ground
Raise the crosses of the condemned
Proclaim judgement with blood
Triumph for the killers of men

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

Trapped in this prison awaiting my death
Condemned to die by draconian means
An eye for an eye is the rule of this land
But the victim in question did not die by my

Hand
A mockery of justice
Inequity
The murderer will live but I will die

Strapped to a chair unable to breathe
Other condemned have died before me
Constrained in the chair I saw fear in their eyes
The executioner smiled as he took their

Lives
Crushing their windpipes
Garroted
Throttled with iron they succumb to death

The strangulation chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain

A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true

The strangulation chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release

A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now

My day has come now it's my turn to die
Hands tied they lead me away
The executioner collars my neck
In terror I wait for my strangulation
My strangulation, my strangulation

Death
My mind slips to darkness
Unconscious forever
The crime they committed they will not know

The strangulation chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain

A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true

The strangulation chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release

A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now

Butchers drag me to the rack
Bind my hands to the bar
Legs are fastened to the table
Hooded man unsheathes his knife

Incisions will be made
Blood drips from the blade
Visceral display

Hook attached inside
Cavity gaping wide
Soon I will die

Intestinal crank

Merciless, they turn the crank
Interrogation has begun
Awake I'm being disemboweled
Rotation pulling out the guts

Excruciating pain
Body starts to strain
Struggle in vain

Tortured by this tool
Intestines on the spool
Barbarous cruelty

Intestinal crank
Intestinal crank

Winding
Innards

And the crank will turn
And the crank will turn

Turning
Pulling

Unremitting pain
Turn the crank again

Twisting
Coiling

Drawing out the guts
Drawing out the guts

The rack
Stretching

Snapping cartilage
Dislocate joints

Writhing
Broken

I will die in pain
I will die in pain

Torment
Endless

Disemboweled alive
Disemboweled alive

Intestinal crank

The blade goes in you and it enters smooth
Disturbing moans begin to soothe
Scraping bone with steel to feel it once
Keep pushing hard it never stops

Had to do it
Had to put it in your gut
Nothing to it
Grab the handle let it slice

Heart polluted
As it's cut out of your chest
Gushing fluids
Bleeding it dry

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

The blade has always done its job well
Seems like its work is never done
Scraping bone with steel to feel it twice
Keep pushing hard it doesn't stop

Desecrated
A body rid of living
Future faded
Gaping hole from front to back

Heart dissected
As it sits upon your chest
Gushing fluids
Drain you empty

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

Bleed it dry
Bleed it dry
Drain you empty
Drain you empty

Bleed it dry
Bleed it dry
Drain you empty
Drain you empty

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

Bound blindfolded
Thickened liquid soaks my feet it's rising upward
Shrieks of panic
Hardened liquid traps my feet insanity is closer

I don't want to die
No one hears my cries
Liquid to my knees
Encased in concrete
Come to realize
My life won't last long
Hardened to my knees
Encased in concrete

Can't break free immobilized
Thinning air asphyxiates
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over

Almost covered
Thickened liquid to my chest it's rising upward
Silent panic
Hardened liquid to my chest insanity is here

Gag
A tube is forced down my throat to breathe
Air
Convulsions from the oxygen intake
Lungs
Are barely expanding slow suffocation
Choke
Ice cold cement is poured over my head

Massive pressure as it sets
Never to be seen again
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over

Wanted to survive
No one heard my cries
Liquid transforming
Encased in concrete
Come to realize My life won't last long
Shrouding my body
Encased in concrete

Encased in concrete
Encased in concrete
Encased in concrete

The silence breakes the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Twelve thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure

Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride

Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood

Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than death

I am on the rock and then I check a stock
I have to run like a fugitive to save the life I live
I'm going to be iron like a lion in Zion
I'm going to be iron like a lion in Zion
Iron lion Zion

I'm on the run but I have got no gun
See they want to be the star
So they fighting tribal war
And they saying iron like a lion in Zion
Iron like a lion in Zion
Iron lion Zion

I'm on the rock, running and you running
I take a stock, running like a fugitive
I had to run like a fugitive just to save the life I live
I am going to be iron like a lion in Zion
I am going to be iron like a lion in Zion

Iron lion Zion, iron lion Zion, iron lion Zion
Iron like a lion in Zion, iron like a lion in Zion
Iron like a lion in Zion

When I woke up this morning, it was raining
Yeah, it was pouring again
Still I think the birds were singing
I couldn't hear them through the din
Couldn't hear them

Will you send me a picture, so I can remember?
Will you send me a picture, so I can

We're passing the bottle over to you
Across the floor of our sinking, dug-out canoe
We got so drunk that night, we got so drunk that night
I hardly remember driving you home
Or was I driving you away?

Will you send me a picture, so I can remember?
Will you send me a picture, so I can

Iron this on when you get home

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
I heard that old rag man now making his rounds
He came right to my alley Lord with sorrowful sounds
Crying rags old iron and pulling his cart
Ask him how much he'd give me for my broken heart

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
So I asked that old rag man how much he would pay
For a heart that was broken baby when you went away
For a burnt out old love light that no longer beams
And a couple of slightly used second hand dreams

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
For those big empty promises you used to make
For those memories of you that are no longer sweet
I wish he could haul them off down the street

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
When love doesn't last tell me what is it worth
It was once mama's most precious possession on earth
When I asked that old rag man if he'd like to buy
He just shook his head and continued to cry

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron rags old iron

I am on the rock and then I check a stock

To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron Big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip The Big Iron on his hip

To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'",  came a whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip"

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Five Iron Frenzy
They were good,
They were good,
They were really really really good
Five Iron Frenzy
And when you see them
We really really think you should
Thank them for being so cool and so awesome
And thank them for being so neato
Look at their teeth and then tell them to floss them
I think reese is wearing a speedo

Five Iron Frenzy
When they were good, they were good
They were really, really, really good

Five Iron Frenzy
Yeah, when you see them
We really, really think you should
Thank them for giving
Their blood, sweat, and tears
Yeah, their music we won't let it stop

Then taunt them until they get angry
And bite you
Then go get yourself a tetanus shot

Have you ever been dumb enough to do what you wanted to do
Without good reason coming over you?
Have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel?
Take back those years for something real

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will

Have you ever been drunk enough to say what you wanted to say
Without no words getting in the way?
Have you ever been in love enough to be who you wanted to be?
I won't mind you if you won't mind me

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will

Can you believe we're older?
I won't believe it's over now
Do you remember being children?
Do you remember when? Now

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Held against my will

Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares.

In thrall to the evil lord
A procession of the damned
Sweating blood to serve the beast
Desolation of their souls

They slave in fire
Whips of Hades at their backs
The Scourge of Iron
Hell's eternal pact

Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

On earth they lived by force
Now the villains march in chains
Men of violence doomed in death
Their reward for a life of sin

They slave for eons
There will be no relief
Mere pawns of evil
Used and then enslaved

Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

Lash
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

Demonic sadists
Flay the damned with steel
The whip strips flesh

Torments beyond the material world
Skinless, bleeding
Robbed of pride and power

In the grip of the infernal
And the evil will not die
Iron whip will be relentless
And the pain will never end

Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of iron
Rending flesh

Lash
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

The iron man came to the top of the cliff
How far had he walked nobody knows
Where had he come from nobody knows
How was he made, nobody knows
Taller than a house, the iron man stood
At the top of the cliff in the darkness

The wind sang through his iron fingers
And his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin
But as big as a bedroom
Slowly turned to the right, slowly turned to the left
He was hearing the sea

His eyes like headlamps, glowed white then red
Then infra-red, searching the sea
Never before had the iron man seen the sea

He swayed in the strong wind that pressed against his back
He swayed forward on the brink of the high cliff
And his right foot, his enormous iron right foot
Lifted-up out into space

And the iron man stepped forward, off the cliff into nothingness
Crash
Down the cliff, the iron man came toppling head over heels
Crash, crash, crash

From rock to rock, tumbling slowly
And as he crashed and crashed, his iron legs fell off
His iron arms broke off
And the hands broke off the arms

His great iron ears fell off
And his eyes fell out
His great iron head fell off

All the separate pieces tumbled scattered crashing
Bumping clanging down, on to the rocky beach far below
Then silence

Nobody knew the iron man had fallen
Nobody knew the iron man had fallen

Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

[Chorus]
Oh Well, wherever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head.
Iron Maiden wants you for dead.

Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares.

Hurry up and wait

For you or me

The story of our lives?

Death to me
And life for you

On thin ice
And I hope it doesn't break

And four empty hearts

Go for a ride
In the still of the night
And morning brings forth
All this wonderful delight
Couldn't have made it more plain
When I heard that soft refrain
And I heard you gently sigh

Want to take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly

Lie in the dark
With the sound of the nightingale
Listen for a lark
I will tell you a tale
Breeze is blowin', blowin' outside
Want to take that moonlight ride
When I hear you gently sigh

Want to take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly

Well we're here and we're waiting
For that morning light to shine
And I'm looking at you looking at me looking right back at you
And I'm anticipating
Sounds along the way
Looking at you looking at me looking right back at you, hey

I'll follow the road
That will take me, take me right back home
And carry that load
Where the deer and the provincial angels roam
Happiness touches, touches me now
I know where it came from and how
When I hear you gently sigh

Want to take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over the rooftops of the houses
I heard it one time, I heard it one time in a lullaby
I heard it one time, I heard it one time in a lullaby
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere way over the rooftops of the houses
Heard it one time in a lullaby
Heard it one time, heard it one time in a lullaby

In the land of a thousand dances
I dance with you
I was out I was taking my chances
When dreams came true
When you came into my dream
Like from a whisper to a scream

And it's a real heavy connection
It's just a real heavy connection
It's a real heavy connection
Lalalala

I remember when I got your message in Amsterdam
I was going through my letters
And found a picture-postcard of the Reeperbahn
When you came into the room
Not too late and not too soon

And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
Lalalala

And you came into my dreams
From a whisper to a scream

And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
It's just a real heavy connection
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala

And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
And it's a real heavy connection
Lalalala
Baby, baby, baby
I can't stop this rainbow
Touching my soul
I can't stop this rainbow
In my soul
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

I waited for you
You waited for me
That it seemed like, seemed like a mighty long time

Baby I had to have you
Oh, I had to have you
Come rain, rain or shine

It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin' in your garden
In the California pine

I was standing shivering
I've got the fever in the rain
But I can't come on back to see you
Again and again and again

I said I, I had to have you
Baby I had to have you
Come rain, come rain or shine

It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
And I was standing in your garden

In the California pine
California pine

It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin' in your garden
In the California pine
In the California pine It was a cold wind in August
I was pushed on through September
Oh pushin' through September
In the rain
Pushin' through, pushin' through September
In the rain

Ooh
It was a cold wind in August
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin', standin' in your garden
In the California pine

Here's a tale in history
About a period of tragedy
A man who thought of horrid things
But really sought what happiness brings
Terror instilled within the souls
Of men and women, young and old
Come and listen to me, my friend
He'll make your morale descend

One Boston day, it's sad to say
A newborn child was granted miserable life
Abandoned by his father and
Left alone by death of father's wife

Foster child
Tobacco exporter gave him a chance
History defiled
Twisted by literature, dark and opium enhanced
Irregularity
So far ahead of his time
A spark of a breed
Regarding all of his literature creed

Infamy of tales and poetry
Connecting his themes to his wildest dreams

The maelstrom grew but no one knew
He descended far beyond its spinning walls
Into the pit, the black abyss
His house was collapsing as he searched for El Dorado

Perched upon Pallas was life, hard and callous
The shadows of burden lifted nevermore
The vulture eye of death concealed
By wooden planks below the floor
The quest for solace evolved into sorrow
Lingering obsessions
Intoxication, stimulation, creation
Hindering addictions

Apparently the message in a bottle was lost
For I could see no conclusion
But all of us remaining in the shrouded past
Must remember to further ourselves by obtrusion

Inebriated grin leads the mighty pen
Across the paper as his fears come alive
Satiric whim ignites the brim
Of insanity as Pluto arrives
Swaying cognac barriers
And the beating of his hideous heart
Increasing ever so constantly
Conjuring the ne'er forgotten lore
'Tis only this and nothing more

I love you period

Back when I was goin' to school, I never learned a thing
All I did was daydream, a-waitin' for the bell to ring
I had a certain teacher, I always tried to impress her
When she stood up in the classroom, I would mentally undress her
Then one day I decided, that I would write a little letter
She said the spellin' was a masterpiece, the punctuation could be better
I understood what she was saying, I got the gist of her sentiment
She said I don't mean to be degrading, but here's the way that it shoulda
    went

I love you period
Do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses

Right on up to high school, people said I was a writin' fool
All my letters became really great, with punctuation that was never late
But I was havin' trouble meetin' girls, I never knew the things to say
Soon I had 'em all overwhelmed, when they heard me talk this way, like this

[Chorus]

We have to take off those clothes
We have to party all night
And we have to take off those clothes
To have a good time
Oh no

Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travee and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

We have to take off those clothes
We have to party all night
And we have to take off those clothes
To have a good time
Oh no

Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "did he really just say that shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going up for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

We have to take off those clothes
We have to party all night
And we have to take off those clothes
To have a good time
Oh no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a skam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucka for smucka's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antedotes under my tongue
Whoa

We have to take off those clothes
And we have to party all night
And we have to take off those clothes
To have a good time
Oh no
We have to take off those clothes
And we have to party all night
And we have to take off those clothes
To have a good time
Oh no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

I'm a blue period Picasso stuck on a wall
In the middle of a hall in Barcelona
Trying to figure out how to get down
'Cause this solitude is bringing me down

The paintings around me, they don't understand me
I'm a bit too early, I'm seen as development
Curing adolescence

But I'm not just being blue
'Cause I have fallen, shape and color too
But I miss you
I miss the content

That is the focus, that is what all this school is reading to us
All just a part of what I am
It's just a part of my beating heart
Beating for you

So I beg you please
Please wrap me up, please take me up
Please hold me close unto your breast
Run down the stairs

Out in open air
Away from the ladies, the Japanese tourists
Their guards won't notice cause I'm so hopeless
Take me wherever you really only came from
You will be famous, seen in the headlines

Though you just kindly stole my heart (seen in the headlines)
Because you kindly stole my heart (a world famous artist)

So you think that you are a star
You sashay into a crowded club, everyone knows who you are
And they all say, "Oh, you look so fine
Let's go into a bathroom stall and do another line."

Closing time, the lights come on
You're coming down
Those friends you just made
They slip away

Go on home
Crawl into bed
When the sun goes down
It starts all over again

On the list and you're through the door
Your hand is stamped with a Hollywood kiss, yeah you've got the score
And there's no place you'd rather be than here
These few hours every night when it's all crystal clear

Soon enough the dawn arrives
You're coming down
Click your heels through empty streets
Walk home alone

Close the blinds
And sleep all day
Wait for the night when
It starts all over a...

Take a pill
It's much too real
In the day

Come on, do another line!
It'll make you feel so fine
So you do it every night
'Cause babe, you're outta sight!

Closing time, the lights come on
You're coming down
Those friends you just made
They slip away

Close the blinds
And sleep all day
Wait for the night when
It starts all over again

Just ball.
Just ball.
Just ball.
Just ball.
Just ball.
Just ball.
That's all.
That's all.
Just ball.

Just ball.
Sock it to me.

Tender I remember, how you loved to turn me on
Sweetly so completely, when you sang your sassy song
Did you have a lighthouse, Yes, I'm sure indeed you did
Where you used to take me, where the family jewels were hid

You said, "Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball"
Take me to the ball
You said, "Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all"
Take me to the ball

The ball, the ball, sang your sassy song, sing it
The ball, take me to the ball

There was sugar sweet as candy, there was sweetness on your lips
And you sang it in a love song, and confection surely drips
There was laughter and then after, when we could have danced all night
We got into one another, and I know you know that's right

You said, "Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball"
Take me to the ball
You said, "Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all"
Take me to the ball

I remember how we danced, when you were mine
How we played "the suite" romance and all was fine
How we always took the chance to be divine
Love was always happening, love was happening at the, the ball

The ball was fine-all the time-trying to blow my mind, baby
Take me to the ball
When we danced-to the beat-of a different drummer, baby
Take me to the ball-play it

I remember how we danced, when you were mine

You said (repeat chorus)

Wobble and ball.
Wobble and ball baby.
Do the Wobble.
Do the Ball.

Do the Ball.
Do the Wobble.
Boogaloo,
down Broadway baby.

Do the Boogaloo
all 'round Broadway baby.
Do the Ball.
Baby.

All 'round Broadway baby.
Do the Ball.
Do the Ball baby.
All over Broadway baby.

I'm upper, upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
All the social papers say I've got the biggest balls of all

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls,
And she's got big balls,
But we've got the biggest balls of them all!

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got great balls of fire!

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls,
And she's got big balls,
But we've got the biggest balls of them all!

Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure,
They're the balls that I like best.
And my balls are always bouncing,
To the left and to the right.
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night.

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls,
And she's got big balls,
But we've got the biggest balls of them all!

And I'm just itching to tell you about them
Oh, we have such wonderful fun
Seafood cocktail
Crabs
Crayfish

Workin' on the railroad
Sleepin' on the ground
Eatin' saltine crackers
Ten cents a pound

[Chorus]
Big ball's in Cowtown

Put on your gown
Shake off them sad blues

Big ball's in town

I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey, some misty years ago
Through the mud and the beer, and the blood and the cheers, I've seen champions come and go
So if you got the guts mister, yeah, if you got the balls
If you think it's your time, then step to the line, and bring on your wrecking ball

Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball

Now my home's here in these meadowlands where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes
Here where the blood is spilled, the arena's filled, and giants played their games
So raise up your glasses and let me hear your voices call
Because tonight all the dead are here, so bring on your wrecking ball

Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball

One, two, a one two three four!

Yeah! Hey!

Yeah, we know that come tomorrow, none of this will be here
So hold tight on your anger, you hold tight on your anger
Hold tight to your anger, don't fall to your fears

Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust
And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust
When the game has been decided and we're burning down the clock
And all our little victories and glories have turned into parking lots
When your best hopes and desires are scattered through the wind
And hard times come, and hard times go
And hard times come, and hard times go
And hard times come, and hard times go
And hard times come, and hard times go
And hard times come, and hard times go
Yeah just to come again

Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball)
Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball)
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball

One, two, a one two three four!

[Daz Dillinger + (T-Pain)]
Yeah, help for the helpless!
Big money, big cars.. big weed! [T-Pain adlibs]
Y'all know what time it is! But you better stack that money!
(Awww shit! Ha ha ha ha...)
For baaaiiilll....

I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nan nigga tell... bet not 'nan nigga tell
Yeah!

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggaz sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggaz have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, "NOT GUILTY!!!"

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
They used to have me on that paperwork
'cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
'Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggaz is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house 'cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggaz down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit be - burn the rubber on the West coast

[Chorus - 2X]

[Xzibit (laughing)] y'all know y'all miss that shit

Gonna ball, like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more

I got money in my pocket, I ain't begging for friends
Cadillac, El Dorado, and it's gone to my head
Short time to live, long time to stay dead
I ain't doin' no favors, I ain't asking for none
?Cause I got money, I can pay for my fun
That's the way I want it, that's the way it must be done

I want no special woman, I want no special friend
I want a good time stay, yeah, tomorrow I may be down again
Don't dial my number, I'll tell you when

Gonna ball, like I never did ball before, yeah
Gonna ball, like I never did ball before

A dull perception of an ever-shrinking world
The desire to live outside the given sphere
Set aside the free will and human emotion
How it hurts to know that freedom is gone forever

Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
Piece of a puzzle, a pawn in the game
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
The never will be solved
Thick layers of lies

Is there a choice, or is it in the hands of destiny
No such thing as faith, everything is predestined
The presence of all, and the perception of every feeling
Is just a dream that follows a written script

Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
Piece of a puzzle, a pawn in the game
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
The never will be solved
Thick layers of lies

Use the flesh to breed artificial machinery
Bend the time, the past ahead of us
A well kept secret revealed in an instance
Cut through the thick layers of lies

A piece of a puzzle, a pawn in the game
Piece of a puzzle, cut through the thick layers of
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
Piece of a puzzle, a pawn in the game
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
The never will be solved
Thick layers of lies

the saddest smile can fill my heart with lies
to laugh or cry, that's what it's all about
i just can't figure out

i said goodnight and hung up the phone
stayed up all night 'cause i knew you weren't alone
and all these memories will be my death
the smell of your presence has stained my bed
i used their love to compensate the lack of you, but it's too late
your pretty eyes, i'd give my life
good reason not to ask me out
so drink up and get me drunk and let it drag me all around

Thin Layer Lyrics
Through a thin layer of rubber and a thick rusted armor of drunken lust
I think when our clothes were on we had a different image of
What this was supposed to be
My buzz allowed me to slip into you more comfortably
Here's what I intended, and here is the truth(x2)
The soundtrack to our meeting fills the awkward spaces between our strained breathing
And the only thing between, between the two of us, is your blood and our sweat
I can taste the cigarettes on your tongue while exchanging spit
Here's what I intended, and here is the truth(x2)
Here is the truth (x6)
Now disguise this whining with melody, and I hope that it leaves, leaves you intrigued
And I hope you feel, you feel what I did at the time that this was conceived
Well, the silence is pleasing, between our strained breathing, now it's over with
This is not what I intended

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say "Night-ie night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

I heard it on the radio
Let it be, so I let go
See if it made a difference

I tried to walk a different pace
Show the world, the other face
I hide away because of day

Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, I am not the same
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, if I change

Nothing's ever what it seems
You think you've got it figured out
Then find yourself another layer

A laugh can bring you to your knees
Or lift you till you're flying
Do you wanna live it now or later?

Memory refused to find
Is wasted on the color blind
It fades away, lost in the gray

And all of us who sit alone
Pretending that there's no one home
Behind the door, what're we hiding for

Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, we are all the same
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, if we, if we change, no

Nothing's ever what it seems
You think you've got it figured out
Then find yourself another layer

A laugh can bring you to your knees
Or lift you till you're flying
Do you wanna live it now or later?

You may not get a second chance
Is not all out of my hands
Now is not gonna pass me by

Nothing's ever what it seems
You think you've got it figured out
Then find yourself another layer

A laugh can bring you to your knees
Or lift you till you're flying
Do you wanna live it now or later?

'Cause nothing is ever what it seems
You think you've got it figured out
Then find yourself another layer

A laugh can bring you to your, bring you to your knees
Or lift you till you're flying
Do you wanna live it now or later?

She walks me home
There's a Mercedes parked in our street
So we stop and we discuss
Who on earth the owner could be
That's just like me
I'd evade waking up if the alarm wouldn't ring
I'd walk into quick sand
If I knew how far I'd sink
Twin layers of trouble
Two times that might
Twin layers of lightning
Both of us can strike
We went into a club
Bouncers got no brains
He said both of you are barred
I had to set him straight
Listen Jack, don't you know, I'm a star
(chorus)
Some people have no money
While other people have no tact
If they invite us around
Well they're going to get a double act
We scream and we shout
And then we love and we turn
Then we set a chair on fire
And we watch the whole house burn
(chorus)
It's written in big letters
Graffiti all over town
It says TROUBLEMAKERS ON THE RUN
And both our names are written down
Oh but infamy or fame
Each came in a small dose
I just wish the day would come
When the last one would be so close





There in the day come to me
Straight into my arms
I try to hold it
But it just ran through my fingers
The ocean
They come to me
Straight into my arms
I tried to caress it
But it ran through my fingers

Water will keep running
Rivers will turn
Water will keep running
Rivers will turn
Water will keep running
Rivers will turn
Water will keep running
Rivers will turn

So how can I ever find
What I'm looking for?
When it's been frozen
Stuck at the horizon
The wind blows from north to south
But I'm still where I was
Keep taking some shirts off
And taking them off

Peel off the layers
Peeling it off
Peel off the layers
Peeling it off
Peel off the layers
Peeling it off
Peel off the layers
Peeling it off

I wish I could find a cure
And to know my disease
But like nothing is heard of
The circle of all of life
And let life will carry me to the other side
There is looking just like this
With the sink on the open

Everything is so far
Leaking about
Everything is so far
Leaking about
Everything is so far
Leaking about
Everything is so far
Leaking about

The requested track is not viewable.

Robert leads me into thought
Onion layers wait for you
Bounty of eternal fields

Every muscle knot I feel
Robert tell me what to do
Tell exactly what you're not, yeah

Tails pushing grand whales
Heads hope to have the stuff
Each flag had no sail

Can you believe enough?
And though Diana calls to you
She will never never yield
Every siren has her spot

Four hundred million
Oh that was very far
Robert sweet Onion

Makes me feel so tired
Another layer and layers and layer, oh no
Robert can you find your way?
Show me the way to come

Zugzwang got me in a way
Under my opposing thumb
Brandishing my shield

Robert leads me into thought
Into the dimming blue
Nowhere in this world

For this old Jack-Tar
Three cheers for Robert
To the cinnabar one ponders

Layers and layers and layers and
Layers and layers and layers and
Layers and layers and layers and
Layers and layers and layers and

Robert, Robert, Robert

The bent twig of darkness
Grows the petals of the morning
It shows to them the birds singing
Just behind the dawning

Come dip into the cloud cream lapping
I can't keep my hand on the plough
Because it's dying

But I will lay me down with my arms
Round a rainbow
And I will lay me down to dream

Oh, will your magic
Christmas tree be shining
Gently all around?

Climbing up these figures
The sun is tugging at my shoulder
And every step I take
I think, my feet are getting older

I see the crystal dreams unfolding
I can't keep my eyes on the book
Because it's mouldering

But I will lay me down with my arms
Round a rainbow
And I will lay me down to dream

Oh, will your magic
Christmas tree be shining
Gently all around?

Cracks rack the windows, howls hold the floor
Rains rot the rafters and do you just have to snore?
It's a most inclement climate, for the season of the night
Is that mouse playing football, oh, I thought they didn't like the light?

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

There's mayhem in this mansion, since the cows were coming home
With delirium no sleep um, in a cloud of nylon foam
But release scours the outhouse and a hard rain sears the sky
But if you let the pigs decide it, they will put you in the sty

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

I think I'll get a picture and I think I'll put it on a nail
I think I'll get another one and put it in a pail
But the pail got so rusty I called it red, red, red for fun
And I laughed like a leaver till you ought to seen it run

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

The size of the future declared itself no part
Aloof like a Sultan in the autumn of your heart
But the heart got so hearty, that it pulled for the shore
And the sailors fired a big salute and it made my ears quite sore

And the dawn was sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

I mixed stones and water, just to see what it would do
And the water it got stoney and the stones got watery too
So I mixed my feet with water, just to see what could be seen
And the water it got dirty and the feet they got quite clean

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

When the morning of your eyes comes waking through my shadows
Leaving just a trace of twilight sleep
I whisper to the baby raindrops playing on my window
And tell them gently this is not the time that they should weep

For somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

My Friday evening's footsteps plodding dully through this black town
Are far away now from the world that I'm in
My eyes are listening to some sounds that I think just might be springtime
With daffodils between my toes I'm laughing at their whim

And somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

Oh, somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

The purple sail above me catches all the strength of summer
Fishes stop and ask me where I am bound
I smile and shake my head and say my little ship is sinking
But I kind of like the sea that I'm on and I don't mind if I do drown

And somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

The Mad Hatter's Song Lyrics
Oh seekers of spring how could you not find contentment
In a time of riddling reasons in this land of the blind
By the joke of fate alone
It's sure that as the loved hand leaves you,
You clutch for the slip-stream, the realness to find.
But do what you like, do what you like, do what you like,
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you can,
Do what you can, live till you die
My poor little man.
For Jesus will stretch out his hand no more.
But in the south there's many a waving tree;
Oh would that musky fingers move your pain;
In the warm south winds the lost flowers bloom again.
And if you cried, you know you'd fill a lake with tears,
Still wouldn't turn back the years,
Since the city has took you,
Mad Hatter is on my mind.
So sad, sad to see the way it grew
Those other people that I knew
That have either fell or faltered.
Mad Hatter is on my mind.
And you must have to see clear some time.
Prometheus the problem child,
Still juggling with his brains
Gives his limping leopard's visions
To the miser in his veins.
Within the ruined factory is the normal soul insane
As he sets the sky beneath his heel
And learns away the pain.
But I am the archer the lover of laughter,
And mine is the arrowed flight.
I am the archer, and my eyes yearn after the unsullied sight.
Born of the dark waters of the daughters of night,
Dancing without movement after the clear light.
Oh Perithian fate be kind in the rumbling and trundling rickshaw of time.
Hooked by the heart to the king fisher's line,
I will set my one eye for the shores of the blind.





Oh, who can see in the eyes of fate?
All life alone in its chronic patterns
Oh, swan, let me fly you
To the land of no winds blowing
I know nothing, and know that I know nothing;
All is in the eye, and in its blinks of seeing

So just like the morning
The ghost of the following day
Ory, cry, cry
Rear the rollers wild and stormy
Echoes wholly only lonely long beforey, ory ory

All rivalry and opinion still cast their wild spells
Effort and contrariness change the directions of time
The lion still growls in your hollowness
Please let's be easy, please let's be friends
Watching and learning like small children
Till out of the morning is growing the strength of the day

Ory, cry, cry
Rear the rollers wild and stormy
Echoes wholly only lonely long beforey, ory, ory

Servant of fame or fame for a servant,
You see what you see, you see seldom what is
Servant of fate or fate for a servant,
You see what you see, you see seldom what is

Servant of fate, oh

I wake up in the early when I see my day walk in
I wake up in the early when I start to begin
I drink up my coffee to drive dreams away
And I think about leaving but remain for the day

Oh, glory but I just stay blind
Think about my loving, yes, some of the time

I want to take it easy
Ain't it hard like they say
But I can play

And most any morning, most any morning
I like to be born into my guitar day

They say it's all butterflies
Don't let your dreams get in your eyes
But Orpheus made the sunrise
'Cause he knew how to play

Well, she sings so fadey, I called my guitar lady
She's a noted writer, I just can't seem to let her be
And she is my flower, I call her my easy hour
She's a low special, and baby that's enough for me

I got sorrow spells, I got sorrow spells
She showed up low to the blues away
And it's raining in the ocean, raining in the ocean

And stones on the mountain and just like they say
I'm just the string striker, just the lamplighter
I ain't no price fighter, it's easy to play

Well, she sings like the seashore
Tonight I don't ride on your seesaw
I will call up the angels if they have a little word to say

And I think I'll try cloud walking
It's just my face you see here talking
And it's just the guitar singing
And I have to let her have her way

And it's all right, you're in the graveyard now
And it's all right, you're in the graveyard now

You may weep, you may moan
You may pass your life so gay
But lucky in life, I swear sometimes
Surely going to have to meet your leaving day

Well, she sings like the seashore
Tonight I don't ride on your seesaw
I will call up the angels if they have a little word to say

And I think I'll try cloud walking
It's just my face you see here talking
And it's just the guitar singing
And I have to let her have her way

I'm not the kind to complain
That I never had a girl to love.
Many a fine girl I tried hard to know,
But I think I never tried enough.

Sitting one day by myself,
And I'm thinking, "What could be wrong?"
When this funny little Hedgehog comes running up to me,
And it starts up to sing me this song.

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes,
That you never quite learned the song.

Every day when the sun go down,
And the evening is so very still,
Many a fine girl I've held in my arms,
And I hope there's many more that I will,
But just when everything is going fine,
And absolutely nothing is wrong,
This funny little Hedgehog's always around
And every time he wants to sing me this song.

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes,
That you never quite learned the song.

One day when the moon was full I thought I might settle down,
Found myself a pretty little girl,
And I stopped all my running around;
But just when the preacher come along,
And he's just gonna pop on the ring,
This funny little Hedgehog comes
Running down the aisle,
And I don't have to tell you what he did sing.

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes,
That you never quite learned the song.

I'm not the kind to complain
That I never had a girl to love;

Many fine girls I've tried hard to know,
But I think I never tried enough.
But now I'll be looking all my days,
And it isn't just me I got to please,
There's this funny little Hedgehog
Who's always around,
And the only words he ever sings to me are these.
Oh, you know all the words and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes,
That you never quite learned the song.

You Know What You Could Be Lyrics
Read your book and lose yourself
In another's thoughts.
He might tell you 'bout what is

Or even 'bout what is not.
And if he's kind and gentle too,
And he loves the world a lot,
His twilight words may melt the slush

Of what you have been taught.
You know what you could be.
Tell me my friend,
Why you worry all the time

What you should been.
Listen to the song of life.
Its rainbow's end won't hold you.
Its crimson shapes and purple sounds,

Softly will enfold you.
It gurgles through the timeless glade,
In quartertone's of lightning.
No policy is up for sale,

In case the truth be frightening.
You know what you could be.
Tell me my friend,
Why you worry all the time
What you should be.

I am the question that cannot be answered
I am the lover that cannot be lost
Yet small are the gifts of my servant the soldier
For time is my offspring, pray what is my name?

My name is death, cannot you see?
All life must turn to me
Oh, cannot you see?
And you must come with me
You must come with me

I'll give you gold and jewels rare
And all my wealth in store
All pleasure's fair
If I may live but a few short years more

Oh lady, lay your jewels aside
No more to glory in your pride
Tarrying here there is no way
Your time has come that you must away
And you must come to clay

Gently tender falls the rain
Washing clean the slate again
But leave me please, behind my brain
This light doesn't shadow on her

Shadows dancing through the pink milk blankets
Where my mind lay dreaming gently of my loving you
Sometimes I think I was true
But then I loved the stone beneath my feet as much, usually

Gently tender snow-drop grows
See the past tense quietly go
Kill the chord but let me know
This light doesn't shadow on her

Shadows dancing through the green bush trees
Where my toes crept breathing lightly of my loving you
Sometimes I think I was true
But then I loved the stone beneath my feet as much, usually

Slowly spitting crawls the snake
See the branches bend and break
Venom that might easily shake
This light doesn't shadow on her

Good, good loving, she gave me good loving
Good, good loving, she gave me good loving
Good, good loving, she gave me good
And now all my wine is water
To her all my wine is water
All water, and my pearls are clear

Good, good loving, she gave me good
Good, good loving, she gave me good
Good, good loving, she gave me good
And now all my wine is water
To her all my wine is water
All water, and my pearls are clear

She gave to me good loving
She gave to me good loving
She gave to me good loving
Ohh good loving

The first time I saw lightning strike
I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street
The sky came crashing down
For a second that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning and I never went back

The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up all the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater and I never went back

Hey hey hey
Well I like it when that lightning comes
Hey hey hey
Yes I like it a lot
Hey hey hey
Yes I'm jumping like a jumping jack
I'm dancing, screaming, itching, squealing, fever feeling
Hot hot hot

The third time I saw lightning strike
It hit me in bed
It threw me around and then left me for dead
For a second that room was on the moon
Then everything went black
I left that house on fire and I never went back

Hey hey hey
Well I like it when that lightning comes
Hey hey hey
Yes I like it a lot
Hey hey hey

Hot hot hot

It's so amazing when a show is captivatin'
Gettin' everybody jumpin' and celebratin'
Only one's own musically be overlayin'
Connecting energy circulatin' inspiration
Together movin' in a synchronized formation
And if you're feelin' down this is survival from depression
You see the lesson is we're rhyming for our mission
Abolish circumstance transmitting from a piston
Taking what I can but keeping peace in moderation
A.P. is like an eagle with the alligator patience
Ready to attack any mic that I am facin'
No limitation where I'm takin' my creation cause

We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that

[Chorus]
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon stop)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (ooh wee)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

I'm more than ready to slice like machete
Leave ya like confetti
Break hearts like Tom Petty
Are you ready?
'cause I am every metaphor
You are nearly ready for
The media predator
'cause I'll bust in your session and kick my own raps, yes
Grab the microphone and show you where the forms at
Tell your girl adapts 'cause the rhyme contact
And she easily attracted to it just like that
It's like this cause the way we captivatin'
We put her in a situation where she debatin'
If she gonna up and jump and leave her mate and
Go promote for us down at the radio station
She likes the
She really likes the music we be makin'
She likes the
She wants to be down when we creatin'
She likes the
She likes the way the vibe's vibratin'
Yo, yo
She likes the way the vibes y'all ratin'

[Chorus]

We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that

We got we got we got it like that
We got got got we got it like that

1,2, 3 Taboo is on the set
It's the family clique broshiggez (aw shit)
Boy don't fret everything's aight
We gonna fall on up when Luis in flight
Yo, fuck the rhyme tryin' we on poetic control
Nevermind the behind and step ahead of your soul
And move on to the next with the words we bless
'cause Black Eyed Peas is comin' hotter than sex
We're writin', rhymin', makin' the beats
Okay, hip hop blazers bringin' the heat
Motivate cut, cut and scratch the groove
Elevate then make them powerful moves
How amazin' is it?
It's so amazin' the blind be gazin'
Even got deaf people listenin' and sayin'
Keep on
And ya don't stop
We got the music that makes your body hot





Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah yeah yeah
uh, uh, uh

I was swerving thru Queens
Fully growin' benz
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My shit is
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar peice
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

Your carmake me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check this out, uh

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my icp
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy just don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'll take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh

You burst out of semi-???
She pulled down the staps to her dress
Reached in the ? sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??
She said "Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,
and give up girl to push whips?"
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said "I would do anthing for ?????
Give deep ? to ? man coats
Take off my ??
Drop to my knees"
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turnin' me off, I can't lie
Keisha said "why?"
I said, "yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid,
then he correct that"
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll,
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh

Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh

Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh

Hot thing, barely twenty one
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, do you want to play with me?

Ooh hoo
Hot thing, baby you dance so good
Hot thing, baby I knew you would
Hot thing, tell me what you see
Hot thing, when you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?

Ooh hoo
Hot thing, maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're going to the Crystal Ball
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late
If you're coming home at all
Hot thing, tell them you found a brand new baby doll
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing, where we could be alone
Hot thing, I could read you poetry
And then we could make a story of our own

Hot thing
Hot, hot, hot thing
Ooh
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing

Hot thing, barely twenty one
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy
Hot thing, don't you want to play with me?

Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home

Hot thing
Ooh, ah, ooh, ooh

Since you've gone
The moon, the sun, the stars in the sky
Know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine;
Now you've gone.

Since you've gone
My heart, my lips, my tear-dimmed eyes,
A lonely soul within me cries.
I acted smart, broke your heart;
Now you've gone.

Oh,  what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted.
The love that I've tasted.
I was wrong; now you've gone

Oh,  what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted.
The love that I've tasted.
I was wrong; now you've gone

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
and maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
But right now..

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains..

You're gone..
You're gone..
Baby you're gone
Girl you're gone, baby girl, you're gone..
You're gone..
You're...

I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
and maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
and find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
and I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah....

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains

You're gone..
You're gone..
You're gone
You're gone...you're gone.. you're....
Gone

Ohhh...

Oh what'll I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where will I turn to
Baby where will I be
We are apart
Am I still in your heart?
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains

Been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains

You're gone..
You're gone..
You're gone
You're gone
Gone
You're gone..

But the truth remains
You're....






Some sunny day-hay baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find out you're alone
Cause Ill be gone
Gone, gone, gone really gone
Gone, ga-gone, cause you done me wrong

Everyone that you meet baby
As you walk down the street baby
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone
Why you're on your own
Just say I'm gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, ga-gone, cause you done me wrong

If you change your way baby
You might get me to stay baby
Ya better hurry up if ya don't wanna be alone
Or Ill be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, Ga-gone
Cause you done me wrong

I've died a thousand times since you went away
Life is just a heartache I'm lonely night and day
I pray that you'll come back and love me ever more
And make me live again like you made me live before
Make me live again life has vanished since you've gone
This world I'm living in is so empty and alone
I pray that you'll come back and love me ever more
And make me live again like you made me live before
[ piano ]
Make me live again...

Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night, black night,
I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Oh I went down to missing persons told Captain bout you
I told him just what you look like and asked him if anybody help me find you
I told him bout the time you've cheated and how your conscience bothered you
You saw me cryin' and played in sorrow didn't know I've forgiven you
Well all of the people stand then round me seem so blue
The Captain he told me that they were looking for a missing person too
Before he handled my shoulder and said we'll see what we can do
For in the world of missing persons I know your baby is sad as you
[ guitar ]
I cried oh Captain if you can't find her I don't know what I'll do
He looked at me and said we'll try sir to bring your baby back to you
And now I am walking all my shoes out searching each tree an avenue
And until I find you baby I'll be a missing person too
And until I find you baby I'll be a missing person too

Oh, oh, oh, oh I feel that old heartache again the one stat started when I loved you
I told myself it was over I was happy but then I saw you and it started again
I saw you dancing with somebody new and you had put him in my place with you
You looked at me and saw my teardrops begin I looked you and it started again
How long how long will it last tell me tell me will time ever pass
Oh, oh, oh, oh I feel that old heartache again

Well if I own the world and all its treasures from the mountain side to the rolling sea
Still darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me
Well if I was a king of a mighty nation and anything I touch or see
Still darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me
To lose your love would leave me cold my heart would go from young to old
I'd lose my fate and what I'd say I'd know such grief I'd run away
No other's kiss would have no meaning and other's love could never be
Cause darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me
To lose your love
Cause darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me

You dedicated you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine

Since U Been Gone

And all you'd ever hear me say

But Since U Been Gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
What I want
Since U Been Gone

How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah
Since U Been Gone

How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
I guess you never felt that way

But Since U Been Gone
I can breathe for the first time

Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you

Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and maked her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that.. maybe I...
Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone..
She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change, she was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out, God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin, they ain't sayin...
Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late all I wanna do is fix my mistakes
Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I"ll..
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone..
I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone..
Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through

It's a wonder of wonders like a magical spring
How I met you I loved you and it changed everything
But the greatest of wonders just a thing it could be
My reason for living is because you love me
Since I know that you need me and your love I can feel
My life has a meaning and my fate is so real
Love has answered life's questions for at last I can see
My reason for living is because you love me

In your love there's a rightness that no words can explain
Like the living in heaven or that sun follows rain
I see goodness and beauty that I never did see
My reason for living is because you love me
Since I know that you need me...
My reason for living is because you love me

Well you think I'll be lonely you think I'll be blue
Well you think that I'll worry worry over you well I will yes I will
Well you think that I'll miss you miss you night and day
You think I will walk the streets while you're away yes I will you know I will
I'm not a bitty shame to say that you're the one I love
From now until eternity I swear by stars above
Well you think I'll try to get you back try with all my might
You think I'll keep on crying when you're not in sight well I will yes I will
[ ac.guitar ]
I'm not a bitty shame to say that you're the one I love
From now until eternity I swear by stars above
Well you think I'll always be the way I've always been
You think that if you'll ask me to I'll come back again yes I will you know I will

I'll try anything that's new if something old won't do
If I can make you happy when you're feeling blue
Cause I love you yes I love you all of the time
I love every breath you take I love the love you make
I love the way you walk even when you walk away
Cause I want you yes I want you all of the time
But don't go too far when you walk away cause I want you near near me night and day
I can't do without things you do for me in your own sweet love able way
I love everything you do and everything you say
I love you most of all cause you always go my way
When I need you and I need you all of the time
But don't go too far

I saw God on the mountain he was grand beyond compare
How do I know I saw him because the mountain was there
I saw God by the seashore saw his presence everywhere
How do I know I saw him because the sea was there

(I saw God in the garden saw his tender loving care
How do I know I saw him) a rose was blooming there
But I see God most clearly each night when I climb the stairs
How do I know I see him my love lies sleeping there

[Chorus]
That'll be me you'll see
Walking away
That'll be me you'll see
For the last time today
That'll be me you'll see
For not very long
'Cause that'll be me
You'll see
That'll be gone

Remember how you warned me
'Bout all your leavin' plans
Well I know this might seem
Unexpected
So prepare yourself
The best you can

[Chorus]

Think back on when
you threatened
And never left no doubt
Although this could be
Kinda sudden
I'm sure you can
Figure it all out

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Don't be sad 'cause you got
What you wanted
You should be glad to know
That I'm finally gone
Don't feel bad or be
Disappointed
'Cause you got what you
Want all along

Wasn't it you who said a
Blinded fool could see the
Clear plain truth about how
Deeply cruel it is to
Live a lie here with each other
And mourn a love that
Won't recover
As I recall those were the very
Words I heard you use

[Chorus]

Wasn't it me who asked so
Stupidly if there were
Things that I could maybe
Do or try to somehow
Hold what fell apart together
But you just coldly told me never
To even entertain the thought
That our love would survive

[Chorus]

This much I know
She'll never come back to me
This much I know
She meant what she said
This much I know
It's taught me all about misery
I just learn kinda slow
This much I know

This much I feel
I should have reached out to her
This much I feel
I tried it too late
This much I feel
How empty the world can be
And so painfully real
This much I feel

I've had second thoughts about
Every reason
We let love slip away
From our lives
And there's no place left to look
That I don't see some
Small reminder
Of all the chances
I just let go by

This much I need
To wake up once and find she's not gone
This much I need
But I'll never have
This much I need
Words to speak without missing her
Or just some new way to breathe
This much I need

I've seen 'em watch you and
Make plans what they'll do when
Someday you are no longer mine

I've heard 'em carry on about
How when I'm finally gone they're
Gonna treat you oh so fine

But I could have told them that
They'd never hold you if they tried

I could have told them
You bend and fold men who
Thought they would have you
As a prize
I could have told them
Those foolish soul'd men that
They'd never hold you if they tried

I've been made real aware of
Pleasure that they'll share with
You soon as I slip your mind

I've listened to 'em boast how
I'll just be a ghost once
They start takin' up your time

But I could have told them that
They'd never hold you if they tried

If you`re part of my love
Don`t leave home tonight
While we`re sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world`s a tiny bubble
Floating inside
Those of us who notice are
Expected to hide
All the world`s a tiny bubble
Floating inside, the truth

When I look in your eyes
I can see the sky
Shining down upon the perfect garden
All the world`s a tiny bubble
Floating inside
Those of us who notice are
Expected to hide
All the world`s a tiny bubble
Floating inside the truth

You can`t imagine just what I've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we

If you`re part of my love
Don`t leave home tonight
While we`re sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world`s a tiny bubble
Floating inside

Muscle baby won't let go

Is she an active beauty?
I should say so

Wooden bones and pretty lashes
Iodine for your baby's gashes
Little tombs for your baby's ashes

It's a tiny town, & you can hang around
With me
And it's a tiny town, & ev'rybody knows what
You been doin'
'Cause it's a tiny town, teeny weeny town, tiny town, tiny town
And ev'ry little town, if you look around
Is a tiny town, tiny town, tiny town

Be careful my darlin'
What you say and do
The shit that you make
Comes right back to you

And the whole wide world is a tiny town
Full of tiny ideas
With each tiny heart pumpin' up and down
Come by tiny with me

Such a tiny town, but we have trouble
Livin' with each other
Some would knock you down
Someone else would like to steal your lover

It's a tiny town and it's enough to make you
Lose your mind
And mother nature say ? she don't play that way
So quit your cryin'

Mama still loves you
When you go astray
You don't need to push
Her in her grave

In my tiny mind you are tiny too
I'll be tiny tonight
For each tiny me there's a tiny you
Close your tiny town eyes

And the birds sweetly singin'
In the tiny town trees
And the animals ask what we?re doin?
It's as plain as can be

I see your sadness
Like birds in the air
I see them all
Flying away

In each tiny heart in this tiny world
Is a tiny desire
And each tiny boy and each tiny girl
Close their tiny town eyes

(Repeat 1st chorus)

And the whole wide world is a tiny town
Full of tiny ideas
With our tiny hearts pumpin' up and down
Come be tiny with me

The tears I cannot hide
My friends all know it baby
The tears I cannot hide
You've changed your disposition
And thrown my love aside


Be fair with me baby
Our love can start anew
Please be fair with me baby
Our love can start anew
I'm blue and helpless baby
And I'm worried over you
Yes, I'm worried
I've got the helpless blues

Ever stop to wonder
Should I question
Move a stone look under
Should I judge

How you have changed my friend
You're not the same my friend
Do you lose sleep at night
Do you ever stop to think
Where it went wrong for you
Who turned your reds to blue

Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart

Ever stop to wonder
I should not question
Move a stone look under
I should not judge

They say you're never lonely
They say you're with the best
But when they turn those lights out
I bet you spin and turn
And cry just like the rest
And cry just like a baby

Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart

Ever stop to wonder
I should not question
Move a stone look under
I should not judge

No need for desperation
No need for sweet revenge
Please try to remember
The door is always there
Don't you walk on by
The door is always there

All you want to do is kick it in
All you got to do is walk right in

Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart

Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart

Who put those tiny daggers in your heart
Oh yeah
In your heart
Yeah

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway

This is your nightmare calling
It's the downside of life in the city
Trouble will always find you
That's the problem with life in the city
It's always a pity
When someone goes under

I'll show you the worst side of life
That you thought was forgotten forever
It's not that it's even there
But it's always lurking around
Like a child of the Jago
A child of the Jago
Yeah yeah

The city's a cemetery
And everywhere that you dig is another
Opening up beneath you
And the bad things are pulling you under
And once you go under
You're gone and forgotten

There's so little symmetry
Between the rooftop pools in the sewer
It's easy to disappear
When you know that nobody would miss you
Like a child of the Jago
A child of the Jago
Yeah yeah

There's always been weary souls
That look like they're straight out of fiction
Wretched and weather-beaten
With the wind blowing rain in their faces
It always disgraces
The most modern places

There's always a worse kind of place
Where it would shock even the sick or the twisted
The pocket is there for the picking
On the clothes of the living or just dead
The difference is minor
To a child of the Jago
Yeah yeah

The future is medieval
The future is medieval
The future is medieval
The future is medieval
Yeah yeah

The future is medieval
The future is medieval
The future is medieval
The future is medieval
Yeah yeah

The future is medieval
The future is medieval

There's something in your soul that makes me feel so old
In fact, I think I've died about six hundred times
There's less of me now and more of me then
I'm moving back to the age of men

Jump off the tarmac, there's no stagecoach speed limit
Outside the office hangs the man on the gibbet
Soft lenses, grow to glasses
Small world, dimly seen through cataracts

Your program, newspaper
So they say

Rumor spread by word of mouth
Jump onto the escalator
Press the button on the lift
Raise the dust on old stair carpets

Endless treads like waves of regret
Now it seems, I'm going madder
Falling off this rotting ladder
Soft lenses, grow to glasses

Small world, dimly seen through cataracts
Jump on to the escalator
Press the button on the lift
Raise the dust on old stair carpets

Endless treads like waves of regret
Now it seems, I'm going madder
Falling off this rotting ladder
Your program, newspaper

Rumor spread by word of mouth

I took a drug
One hundred times stronger than acid
I took a drug
One thousand times stronger than aspirin

(Fall asleep here, wake up somewhere)
I took a drug
The pain of my life disappeared
(Fall asleep here, wake up somewhere)

I took a drug
I fell asleep fuzzy, woke up clear
(Fall asleep there, wake up somewhere)
I'm waking up here

When I dream I see knights in white satin
When I dream I get mistaken memories of medieval Manhattan

Sleep is the name of the drug I took
Sleep and nothing more
Sleep is the tower of Babel
Sleep is my Utopia

Sleep is the place I feel safest in
Wrapped up in a cotton cocoon
In a topographical ocean
On the dark side of the moon

When I dream I see knights in white satin
When I dream I get mistaken memories of medieval Manhattan

And the world is upside down
But my mind is turning on
Milk is spilling from the murdered sun
I see masturbating monks on 42nd Street

Rats carry the plague to Chinatown
Cathedrals in the well of an elevator shaft
The water towers so many onion domes
The channel 12 commercials all star Joan of Arc

On Broadway a lamb is lying down
Where have they gone, the snows of Villon?
They are falling on Manhattan as rain

Never wake me, boy
If you wake me I'll die
If you wake me you'll destroy this perfect world I see
When I dream
(Mistaken memories of medieval Manhattan)
When I dream

They tried to conquer the world with science
And medieval self-reliance
Neither of which behoove
All that's of concern is a groove

They tried to conquer the world with blinding flash
Instead reduced it to a solitary ash
While trying to improve on a ray of light
And a grip on the groove

Well, I'm a species so rare, the human eyes hardly seen
A thin line between divine and killing machine
A dark side of the light that no one ever should see
Oh, I feel for the foolish for fucking with me

There's a war inside me but the water is still
You'll be safer every time assuming it will
Yet to lose my composure, I don't normally do
I just thought that you should know I've been sicker than you

You don't know me, no record can't tell ya
Oh oh, I'm the great pretender
I said you don't know me, no record can't tell ya
Oh oh, I'm the great pretender

You say you want my pain, my own personal pain
A lot of hurt, heartache and hard times, it's hard to explain
I could feel the anger starting to happen again
I'd bust your head and break your brain for five minutes of fame

My heart beats with unconditional love
But beware of the blackness that it's capable of
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You got to travel the road of a troubled soul
I'm tryin' so hard not to lose control
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You don't know me, no record can't tell ya
Oh oh, I'm the great pretender, some great pretender
I said you don't know me, no record can't tell ya
Oh oh, I'm the great pretender, some great pretender

They say, "In life you shouldn't worry
Just got to let the wind blow", hey
You see every day I'm strugglin'
For the strength to let it go, hey

You don't know me
(No record can't tell ya)
You don't know me
I'm tryin' so hard
Said you don't know, oh oh, oh oh
Said you don't know me
No record can't tell ya

I'm the great, I'm the great pretender
I said you don't know me
I'm the great pretender
Said you don't know
No record can't tell ya

Oh oh, I'm the great pretender
I'm the great pretender
You don't know me
No record can't tell ya
Oh oh, I'm the great pretender
I said you don't know me

I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are

I first heard you on the radio
And felt my heart explode
No other choice, I heard a voice and fell in love with you
From St. Bartholomew's to Gloucester Avenue
No one can do what you do, oh

I thought you were American, oh oh oh
I thought you were American, oh oh oh

I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are

Then I saw you in a centrefold
You were looking cold
In just an artfully positioned piece of mistletoe
Mentally dressing you, I want to rescue you
And make you mine, all mine, oh

I thought you were a miracle, oh oh oh
I thought you were a miracle, oh oh oh

Hey!

I thought you were incredible, oh oh oh
I thought you were incredible, oh oh oh

I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are

I saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light
Flashing on a screen, visions of my whole life.
I used to chase the moment of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire.

It was just a, nothing but a grand illusion.
Heart was quicker than the eye.
Nothing but a grand illusion,
Legend in my own mind.

I held you in my arms till the other side of midnight.
Kept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights.
Standing on the threshold of desire,
Caught between the madness and the fire.

[Chorus]

It was all a grand illusion.
Hand was quicker than the eye.
Nothing but a grand illusion,
Legends in our own minds.

I used to chase the moments of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire.

It was just a, nothing but a, it was all a grand illusion.
Nothing but a grand illusion.
It was all a grand illusion,
Legend in my own mind.

It was just a grand illusion.
Nothing but a grand illusion.
It was just a grand illusion,
Legend in our own mind.

Late at night
When it's dark and cold
I reach out
For someone to hold
When I'm blue
When I'm lonely
She comes through
She's the only one who can
My baby grand
Is all I need

In my time
I've wandered everywhere
Around this world
She would always be there
Any day
Any hour
All it takes
Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's
Been good to me

I've had friends
But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Came home with me

Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's
Been good to me

Stick up, hands in the air
You move, you lose 'cause the ICE don't care
No chance to run, don't shout
Flinch an inch I'm gonna take you out
Grand larcenist, soloist, felonist, vocalist
Crime's my rhyme, but here's a new twist
I ain't here for your gold bro
All I want is the show
This is Grand Larceny

Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny

I lay low for a show and then I go
Seal the motherfucker then we count the dough
It's kinda like robbin' but it's legally down
And now days if it ain't legal I don't fuck around
I get my thrill when I ill and a jam is filled
With 10.000 screamin' people, now that's the pill
Who's gonna dog the set? The ICE will
And once I'm in effect it's overkill
Kinda like a hold-up all the tickets sold up
And then the black stretch limo cold rolls up
And then the posse breaks, high off the Cold Duck
And then I set the mic to show destruct
Even if we open up, that don't mean nothing
I rock the rhymes .E does the cuttin'
Call it shownappin' I take a hostage a night
Dog shit and break out on the next flight
This is Grand Larceny

Grand Larceny

I'm a kleptomaniac when a jam is packed
You can fight all night, but you'll still get jacked
By the show stealer, crime rhyme dealer
Rap king pin, L.A. big-wheeler
Got a posse so strong they could lift a tank, rob a bank
But now we steal shows the cops say thanks
Breathe easy 'cause the Syndicate deep
And before we started rappin'
They got no sleep
It's Grand Larceny

Grand Larceny

Just give me a beat, give me a stage to stand on
I know that none y'all ever planned on
A dude from L.A. who could rock shit this way
Have his record go gold, with no radio play
But it happened, The Ice is rappin'
Just listen to my fans that are clappin'
Or come to the show, get in the front row
And watch me steal the motherfucker before your ass can say "HO"
I'm like a time bomb, but I'm a rhyme bomb
Spray the whole audience with napalm
Or something just as hot, I'll bust a rhyme, why not?
Raps hittin' so hard, you'll think you shot
I'll take a show and abduct it
Stone cold house it, if it gets wild
With gasoline I'll douse it
Set it ablaze and then I'll stomp it out
Many burnt emcees know what we're talkin' about
This is Grand Larceny

Promoters on my tail now
'Cause they billed me low
Here I am 'bout to steal another show
So they turn my mic down
Fuck up my audio sound
But too late, we just dogged another town
Rappin' like a Mac 10, as soon as I begin
The only way to stop the stealin'
Is throw me in the pen
But that will never happen
'Cause I'm just cool rappin'
My Larceny is legal, so sorry Captain
I would never steal a style or ever steal a rap
But I'll steal a show in a minute
It's as simple as that
An interstate crook, my pistol's my rhyme book
Any show that I'm on is a show that's took
Better watch my left hook, or your jaw will get shook
If my posse gets mad, it's best you book
From the Grand Larcenist, ICE-T is my name
Got a rap like a mac and a game he same

Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny

Sail away superstars

So if you think your life is complete confusion
Cause your neighbors got it made
Just remember, please, it's a grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same.

I've seen you calm the waters raging in the rivers of my mind
Your spirit blows a breeze into my soul
And I've felt the fire that warms the heart
Knowing that it comes from you
Then I've let it turn as cold as a stone

Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm as close as your shadow
Sometimes I feel like I'm looking up at you

From the bottom of the Grand Canyon, so small and so far
From the Grand Canyon with a hole in my heart
And I'm a long way from where I know I need to be
And there's a Grand Canyon between you and me

I've had the faith that gave me strength for moving any mountainside
I've felt the solid ground beneath my feet
But I've had the bread of idleness while drinking from a well of doubt
And it shakes the core of all I believe

Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm as close as your shadow
Sometimes I feel like I'm looking up at you

From the bottom of the Grand Canyon, so small and so far
From the Grand Canyon with a hole in my heart
And I'm a long way from where I know I need to be
And there's a Grand Canyon between you and me
There's a Grand Canyon between you and me

Sometimes I feel like I'm as close as your shadow
Sometimes I feel like I'm looking up at you

From the bottom of the Grand Canyon, so small and so far
From the Grand Canyon with a hole in my heart
And I'm a long way from where I know I need to be
And there's a Grand Canyon between you and me
And there's a Grand, Grand Canyon between you and me

Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were the one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

And now the people are talking, the people are saying that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano

Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
Cause I keep thinking you were the one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

And now the people are talking, the people are saying that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano

Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper "oh, I love you"
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say "good morning, dear?"

There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

Step right up, come on in

Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Harmony, we need harmony
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune
Harmony, we need harmony
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new

Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Harmony, we need harmony
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune
Harmony, we need harmony
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new

Harmony, harmony
Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day

That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside
Come on now, boy, put it on the line
Take some space just to ease your mind
And to think it through

Sail away superstars
Sail away superstars

So if you think your life is complete confusion
'Cause your neighbors got it made
Just remember, please, please, it's a grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same, we're all the same

Late at night
When it's dark and cold
I reach out
For someone to hold
When I'm blue
When I'm lonely
She comes through
She's the only one who can
My baby grand
Is all I need

In my time
I've wandered everywhere
Around this world
She would always be there
Any day
Any hour
All it takes
Is the power in my hands
This baby grands
Been good to me

I've had friends
But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna
Play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues
Were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life
I've strayed in
And I've got scars
From those dives
I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Is coming home with me

Ever since this gig began
My baby grands
Been good to me

As the opry said

The requested track is not viewable.

The requested track is not viewable.

A to be
Different degrees

So much style without substance
So much stuff without style
It's hard to recognize the real thing
It comes along once in a while

Like a rare and precious metal
Beneath a ton of rock
It takes some time and trouble
To separate from the stock
You sometimes have to listen to
A lot of useless talk

Shapes and forms
Against the norms
Against the run of the mill
Swimming against the stream
Life in two dimensions
Is a mass production scheme

So much poison in power
The principles get left out
So much mind on the matter
The spirit gets forgotten about
Like a righteous inspiration
Overlooked in haste
Like a teardrop in the Ocean
A diamond in the waste
Some world-views are spacious
And some are merely spaced

Against the run of the mill
Static as it seems
We break the surface tension
With our wild kinetic dreams
Curves and lines
Of grand designs

Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper oh I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear

There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Just like she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

Step right up, come on in

The obliteration of your isolation
The complete explosion
Of you fondest notion
This disintegration
is your elevation
It's a grand illusion, it's a grand illusion

You're crying,you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing
A hundred thousand years
There is only one day
And tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion

The devastation of your separation,
The disillusion of
your constitution,
It's exhilaration,it's your liberation
It's a grand illusion,it's a grand illusion

You're crying,you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing a hundred
Thousand years
There is only one day
And tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion

You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no one's gonna stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down

And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me
My baby's a saint
My baby's a saint

I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witch's brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mystery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise

Well a-when the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in
Mm I want to be, I'm gonna be in that number,
Ooo when the saints go marching in.

Oh when the sun yeah begins to shine.
When that old sun begins to shine,
I tell you something I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number,
When the sun begins to shine.

Yeah when my lord calls me home again,
Ah when my lord calls me home again,
I'll tell you I'm gonna be in that number,
Oh when my lord calls me home again.

Oh when the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in
I tell you something I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number,
When the saints go marching in.

Well when the sun yeah begins to shine.
When that sun begins to shine,
I tell you something I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number,
When that old sun begins to shine.

Lazy one time.
Mm mm, yeh, alright, mm, yeah,
Ooo when the saints go marching in.

Yeah when the saints go marching in,
Yeah when the saints go marching in
I tell you something, I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number,
Yeah when the saints go marching in.

Yeah when my lord calls me home again,
Ah when my lord calls me home again,
I'll tell you I'm gonna be in that number,
Oh when the saints go marching in.

Hail the guitar, all tuned down
In a power circle, obey the crowd
All ride a wave, crash right in
Lovers and fighters, adrenaline

The singer spits, our hearts all rise
Energy is visible, we all crush tight
All washed away, tsunami wave
Fragile human, all the same

And now, I face the sound
When all around is burning
I'm like Hermes, drifting down

I am the saint, your path into the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint, the path into the light

Caught in a trap, the systems are down
Communication's broken, I feel underground
Weight of the storm, in sound, we all drown
You'll never understand what drives us all on

And now, I face the sound
And all around is burning
I'm like Hermes, drifting down, down, down, down

I am the saint, your path, the way, the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint, your path, the way, the light

I am the saint, your path into the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint, your path, the way, the light

I am the saint

I'm taking my time
I'll fix it, don't worry now
I'm needing you there
Make sure that you're coming too

All of my life
Is all I'll give you here
The meaning of me
Is something to pursue

You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

Grown ups don't know
How to dream anymore
Their heads in the sand
And they choose to ignore it all

All of my life
Is all I'll give you here
The meaning of me
Is something to pursue

You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

A man inside the boy
You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head





I like all the different people
I like sticky everywhere
Look around, you bet I'll be there!
Hot metal in the sun
Pony in the air
Sooey and saints at the fair

Saints alive you're saying
Walk in ... squares
The hid are out, out for the year
It's a lot of face
A lot of crank air
Eroding around here

Summer's ready
Summer is ready when you are

I like all the different people
I like every kind of fair
In the crowd, you bet I'll be there!
Walkin' around
Going nowhere
Seeing Sooey and saints at the fair

Summer is ready when you are
Summer is ready when you are
Summer's ready
Summer is ready when you are
Summer's ready
Summer is ready when you are

It's a lot of face, crank air

Summer's ready
Summer is ready when you are

I had an icon that glowed in the dark
With psychotropic eyes and a plastic heart
I had a guru, one vision, one dream
I saw the ides of March and they were looking back at me

[Chorus]
Give me unto love
Give me unto truth
Give me unto love
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
The saint of the sonic groove

I have prayed to the invisible man
Hoping for a stake in the promised land
I kissed the feet of blessed Mary Magdalene
Wishing all the time that she would set me free

[Chorus]

I have flown through the cosmic pale
I found the sound that was my holy grail
I rode the beat; I rode the drone
'Cause I am your pilgrim and I'm coming home

[Chorus x2]

You're the youth bangers fight forever more
Raise your golden hammer bring it down like Thor
Ooh the force is going to bring us victory
No foe or rival will stop the energy
It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind

It's the march of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint

Clench your fist a battle's on the way
Shout the truth metal's here to claim the day
Hear the crowd's mighty roar
It verifies assurance that we won another war

It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind

It's the march of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint

It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind

March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint

Oh, when the saints, go marching in,
Yes when the saints go marching in.
Oh Lord I want to be in that ever lovin' number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, when the saints, go marching in,
Yes when the saints go marching in.
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh yes, I had a dear old mother,
And if you should see her before I do,
Won't you tell her that you saw me coming,
I was struttin' straight on through
Oh, when the saints, go marching in,
Yes when the saints go marching in.
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.






Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Oh, when the sun, refuses to shine
I still, want to be in that number
When the sun refuses to shine

Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
I'm going to sing aloud and thunder
Oh, when the saints go marching in

Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Yes, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
I still want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Saint Paul the persecutor
Was a cruel and sinful man
Jesus hit him with a blinding light
And then his life began
I said yeah
I said yeah

Augustin knew temptation
He loved women, wine and song
And all the special pleasures
Of doing something wrong
I said yeah
I said yeah

I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
He'll never make a saint of me

And could you stand the torture
And could you stand the pain
Could you put your faith in Jesus
When you're burning in the flames

And I do believe in miracles
And I want to save my soul
And I know that I'm a sinner
I'm gonna die here in the cold
I said yes, I said yeah

I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me

I thought I heard an angel cry
I thought I saw a teardrop falling from his eye

John the Baptist was a martyr
But he stirred up Herod's hate
And Salome got her wish
To have him served up on a plate
I said yeah
I said yeah

I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me

I thought I heard an angel cry
I thought I saw a teardrop falling from his eye
I thought I saw an angel cry

You'll never make a saint of me
You'll never make a saint of me

I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sunThen dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could feel its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out "Nickels for your pity"
Them downtown boys sure talk grittyIt's so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king if the alley I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everythning cool
A backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straightahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you
back down in your seat
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're outa that hole and back up on the street
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
The cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"
And them downtown boys sure talk grittyIt's so hard to be a saint in the city

Suppertime in the hole
Suppertime in the hole
I shame my family
Shame my home
Suppertime...

Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, boy he's just a-waiting...

All the white boys in their stay-pressed slacks, they're home for the summer from college
Stayin' out late, getting rowdy at the bar, they're looking for trouble uptown
They come up my block, about 5 or 6 of them, smashin' their bottles in the gutter
Yelling all kinds of obscenities, about women and God and law

Another suppertime in the hole
Suppertime
I shame my family
Shame my home
Suppertime...

Young girl turn the corner with her clerk dress on, that girl was my sister
Just got off the night shift at Penningtons Place, just wanna go home and get some sleep
Boys grab her by the waist with their caffeine eyes, their hands all figdet and 'lectric
I picked up a brick from my papa's front yard and threw it at the tallest boy's face
Well blood was streaming like a well that sprung, I couldn't believe what I had just done
Well the other boys ran and this one stayed on the ground and he would never move again

Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row, he's just waiting for a pardon
All us boys on death row, we just waiting for a pardon
All us boys on death row

Yours truly on trial, I testify
I got to keep on running till the well run dry
Yours truly on trial, I testify
I got to keep on running till the well run dry
Yours truly on trial, I testify
I got to keep on running till the well run dry
Yours truly on trial, I testify
I got to keep on running till the well run dry

Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you





She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah

She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multi-colored mirrors on his hobnail boots.

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.

A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust.

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun (bang bang shoot shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (bang bang shoot shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)
Because, (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang shoot shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (bang bang shoot shoot)

Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
Happiness (bang bang shoot shoot)

Well don't you know that happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, (is a warm gun, yeah).

It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table,
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me

Christmas comes this time each year

Well way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas
That you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends all year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer, whoaa
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer (he don't miss no one)

And haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's got to wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Christmas comes this time each year)

Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Christmas comes this time each year)

Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Christmas comes this time each year)

Shares his neighbors with a building
Knows addresses of by heart
Draws a picture of his future
Keeps the paper close at hand

Packs his tongue into a suitcase
Suffers terror on the train
And he wants to start a movement
'Cause he's indestructible

Destructible..suffers terror on the train
He indestructible
And you know they'll never find us
And they'll leave us alone
And if we just keep on talking

Then we'll still make it home
There's commotion and promotion
Now they've done good every war
Sell our pictures to a paper
Now that everyone must know

Trading satellites for substance
Let spectators pay their way
We'll invade the trevi fountain
Now that everyone must pay

Babies mothers tragedy

Been sitting watch your pictures drying on the line
Just a game of mine

The buzz that I've been wakin' with lately
Cant be poured in a coffee cup

Never had a need so strong
Or one to last this long

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait, without you

You give it all but I want more

When all the worlds are lost in snow
I have to move this meaning through;
Disperse the force so far engendered
All near the steam and summer view
And then... remain.

Where steeples crash in fire and thunder,
Where sheets of steel obscure the land,
Here was the place I chose to stand.
Just when I think I'm going under,
I... remain.

Well all the waves of spin are foaming,
And fake muezzin steam and brew,
Formed in the fire of all their longings(? )
This is the way I took it through,
Just when I think I'm going under.
This is the way I thought it through;
This is the way I took it under...

Fallin' down under the cracks
And now, I cannot make a sound
Forgive me if I ask for help
I'm crawling out of the bottom where my every thought
My every thought is consuming
Gimme some excuses, I need to know

If I was under, could I see myself on the floor?
If I should trip inside my mind
Would I be under control of it all?

Time, gimme time, gimme time, gimme

What do you think will help me?
My teeth, chatterin' with every thought
I need some prayers to be answered
I believe I'll be choking on my mind soon
Why won't you help me?
One more time, I expect to get shit

Gimme some excuses
You don't give a fuck

If I was under, could I see myself on the floor?
If I should trip inside my mind
Would I be under control of it all?

Help me
Help me

If I was under, could I see myself on the floor?
If I should trip inside my mind
Would I be under control of it all, control of it all?

Help me
I'm under

I was under the influence

I got what it takes to swim up in it all day
I want you to shake and that'll tell me it was great
When I go
Under

Yeah yeah yeah

Ever wonder how you got in?

Pick a cell you'd like to rot in

Carlos went from college to a prison suit
Asking for election day
Didn't care to lick El Presidente's boots
Got that, Pinochet?

Down under
Disappeared without a trial

We don't have that name on file

Ivan told his brothers in the fellowship
Not to tow the party line
Now he gets to take a sentimental trip
To a prison mine

Down under
Would you care for bread and water?

Down under
This was Daddy's alma mater

Ain't no Yankee jive
Ain't no commie plot
I don't lean left or right
I stand on solid rock

We hold this truth
To be as dear to life as bread
People think better
When they don't have a gun at their head

Miko looked around and saw her Seoul on ice
Organized a student parade
Someone told the state police to shoot on sight
And they all obeyed

Say the word and we will lock you

I got empty point to make
It's about a faith
An empty point of view
It's stinky through and through
So you think you've got some problems?
So you think you've got it bad?
Good boy
Gone bad
So sorry
So sad
Makes you wonder if you can
It takes you puts you in a can
One thing I'm gonna do
Something you don't want to view
(Unknown)
This is mine
This is my world
This is mine
I got a fresh opinion now
I can tell you how
I think it's best just to take it and go under
Oh take some
Swallow you can't miss
Let's you spend some time in bliss
Oh come on down
Oh come on down
Oh welcome
This is my world
This is mine
This is my world
This is all mine
Oh it's all mine





Saigon, it was all gone
The same Coke machines
As the streets I grew on
Down in a mesquite canyon
We come walking along the ridge
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road to town
Up here there's too much brush and canyon
For the CHP choppers to touch down
Ain't lookin' for nothin', just wanna live
Me and the brothers under the bridge
Come the Santa Ana's, man, that dry brush'll light
Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night
We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Had enough of town and the street life
Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife
Now I don't want no trouble
And I ain't got none to give
Me and the brothers under the bridge

I come home in '72
You were just a beautiul light
In your mama's dark eyes of blue
I stood down on the tarmac, I was just a kid
Me and the brothers under the bridge

Come Veterans' Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues
I held your mother's hand
When they passed with the red, white and blue
One minute you're right there
then something slips

Why don't we dance anymore
I'm not ok with that
Why don't we laugh anymore
I'm not ok with that

The years go by like stones under rushing water
We only know when it's gone

Why don't we smile anymore
I'm not ok with that
Why don't we dance slowly
I'm not ok with that

The years go by like stones under rushing water
We only know when it's gone

The years go by like stones under rushing water
We only know when it's gone

Why don't we dance anymore
I'm not ok with that






Don't bury me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under under under

I die every time you walk away
Don't leave me alone with me
See, I'm afraid

Of the darkness
And my demons
And the voices
Saying nothing's going to be OK
I feel it in my heart
Soul mind that I'm losing
You me
You're abusing every reason
I have left to live

Don't bury me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under under under

Lost trust 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I ever owned gone
But I'm still breathing
Through the thunder
And the fire and the madness
Just to let you shoot me down again
But I'm still breathing
I feel it in my veins skin bones
That I'm losing you me
You're confusing
Every reason I have left to live

Don't bury me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under under under

Chasing you but you don't look back
Words I threw that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you
Chasing you but you don't look back
Words I threw that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you

Don't bury me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under under under
Only you can send me under, yeah

Oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire proof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) we'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) people walking above
(Under the boardwalk) we'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

In the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
Mm-mm, you can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) out of the sun

"Sell a mirage," says The Voice of The Cunning
Button down, yes-men, market it well
"Sell a mirage and the hordes come running"
Cheap grace rains like pennies from Hell

In the cool flame flickers some psychopath stick man
Weeping to the cameras, begging for trust
But the seeds lie here in a proud heart needing your covering under

Under the blood
Under the blood
A cover under the blood

Under the blood
Under the blood
There's a refuge under the blood

Shutter the room, there's a light penetrating
Stick men tremble and cover their eyes
Shutter this room, there's a judgment waiting
Cheap grace rains down quite a surprise

In the stained glass ghetto
There's a hired hand setting up a table
In remembrance of no one at all

And if I'm that man
Could your mercy bring me back
Into a communion?

Under the blood
Under the blood
Communion under the blood

Under the blood
Under the blood
Can you reach me?

Under the blood
There's a light in the hollow
Under the blood
Where you lead, I will follow

And the blitzkrieg drones
And the bleeding earth groans
And your comforter heals me, whispering hope

You're alive
In the soul of a sinner
Cover me under
Under the blood

What a day you had today
It took your smile away
I think we ought to get away
Let's run away

Take me out under the sky
Counting diamonds all through the night
And the moon in the morning light
Out under the sky

And it can happen any day
Everything goes astray
But the starts do us o.k.
Let's run away

Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky

Shake the world off you shoulders
You have the perfect alibi
Just because the world is wide
Out under the sky

Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky
Out under the sky

When all is said and done
Darlin' we are the only ones
There's only you and I
Out under the sky

Open up your heart
Open up your mind
Do what you thinks right
So we don't have to fight
We play a different game
Though the two of us are the same
In the time you were here
The only thing I'd fear is

Time will only tell a story
Of two people living through the glory

When love might tear us apart
But we can't back down
We knew this from the start
And I miss you now
I don't want this to end up that way
I just want you here one more day

Stay

When the feelings gone
There's more for us to work on
But how do we begin
If you won't let me in
Until the bitter end
You and I are friends
And I will stand beside you
Here's nothing I won't do

I'd say you were a supermodel
That don't matter I'd like to get to know you better
All day I'd wanna take your picture
I won't have to if I get to know you better

I'd like, like to get to know you better
I'd like, like to get to know you better
I'd like, like to get to know you better
I'd like, like to get to know you better

One way or another I will get to you
I hope you like me

What can I say to get you into my sweater?
What can I do to get to know you better?

The first time I saw you? I knew
I knew I love you coz my heart stopped
The first time I hear you? I knew
I knew I luv you coz my heart stopped

Coz? I ?la la la la la la
Love You?

Love can make you feel so funny
No house no car not even money
Will make me feel the way
What I?m really tryin to say
I can?t live another day
Without You oh ?without You

The first time I kiss you I knew
I knew I had you coz? your heart stopped
The first time I miss you I knew
I knew I never wanna leave you

Coz? I?la la la la la la
Love You?

Because I...la la la
Love You ?love You?

Do you ever wake up in the morning alone'
And do you ever wish that there was some way you could stay at home'
With somebody who love you and needs you
With somebody who helps to complete you

But I've made mistakes and I know for sure
I won't forget to remember

Love isn't
Always as you see it
Love isn't
Always as you dream it should be
Love isn't
Always gonna find you
But this is love
Cause you're all I'm thinking of

I wanna tell you that I'm sorry I didn't mean that
I wanna say I love you but will I hear those words come back
From somebody who loves me and needs me
From somebody who helps to complete me

But there's one concern that I must consider
Before I start to paint my picture

I'm gonna take my chances
I'm gonna lay my heart out on the line (on the line this time)
I'm gonna love you endlessly
But I'll keep this in the back of my mind

You're a stranger
A strange lover
You're my addiction I can't get over
You seduce me
Then you recluse me
Always on the run are you a refugee'
While I'm in love
You're out having fun
With your friends but not with number one
Passion killer
Sex thriller
All these things that make you a strange lover

I have waited so long to belong to you
And now that here all I fear

I've been wasting my time
Writing these silly rhymes
To make you mine
Love will come and go
Now you're back on the saddle
And I'm alone
Strange lover come back home

In and out of
This thing we call love
But when it's in
Its fits like a glove
I'm in danger of losing a stranger
Tell me how did we ever end up together

Making up with you
Sealed with a kiss
On my lips

Making love to you
Holding nothing back
I miss that

Do you ever think about
Do you think about us?
What we may have lost
And do you ever wonder why?
Why we didn't try
Just a little harder

Tell me
Why did you have to leave?
Lately
It's been getting so hard to breathe
I broke down but I'll turn it around
So tell me
So tell me

Staring at your smile
And your eyes that never lie
Made it hard to say goodbye

Now I'm staring at the walls
You're alone inside my head
I wish we could say what we wasn't said

Sound is the same for all the world
Everybody has a heart
Everybody gets a feeling
Let's play!
Sound box!
Rock, reggae, jazz, mbalax
All around the world, the same
Pachanga, soul music, rhythm and blues
The same
La samba, la rumba, cha-cha-cha
The same
Sound is the same for all the world
Everybody has a heart
Everybody gets a feeling
Mbaqanga, ziglibiti, high life music
The same
Merengue, funk, Chinese music
The same
Bossa nova, soul makossa, rap music
The same
Come on people, dance
Everybody in the world has a culture
Believe what you believe
Respect your customs
Everybody must do what the heart says
Don't cause trouble
Treat people well
Be sociable
Exchange ideas
Music is the same the world over
Musicians, too, are cut from the same cloth
We're aiming to entertain you

Maybe somewhere else will not be half as cold as me
The curtains drawn, the winter sun makes patterns on your face
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same

Baby, won't you breathe?
Baby, won't you breathe?

Hold me in your freezing arms before we have to go
I wince a little but it's not because I know the truth
The windshield of your little car is frosted through the clouds
A clear heart of our own peers eyes me shiver on the seats
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same

Treat it as a task, treat it as a task
Baby, won't you breathe?
Baby, won't you breathe?
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same

In an imaginary world every boy and every girl
They'd all get the same things, they'd all get the same things
A little dough, a lot of love, with a mom and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things, yeah

But now the world is real, and it don't matter how you feel
'Cause we don't get the same things, we don't get the same things
You gotta work to stay alive, forty hours from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things, no

But all my gangster friends, and all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I'm saying we all want the same thing
DJ's in the clubs, Jesus freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing, yeah

And, I think about the way all the politicians say
They say they wanna change things
You know they say they wanna change things
But every year, they take some more and I don't know what it's for
You know they never change things

But, if you want to make it stop, oh, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes, doing some different things, yeah
Get up out your bed, you better think outside your head
And, you won't get the same things, no

But all my gangster friends, and all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I'm saying we all want the same thing
DJ's in the clubs, Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing, yeah

All my ex-girlfriends, and all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing
I'm saying, they all want the same thing
From Wall Street to the hood, New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing

This is a message to remind you
There's just one who coast love

But all my gangster friends, and all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I'm saying we all want the same thing
DJ's in the clubs, Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing, yeah

All my ex-girlfriends, and all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing
I'm saying, they all want the same thing
From Wall Street to the hood, New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing

The crowds roll by, and I'm falling in
Everyone's invisible, but it's just pretend

And we all freaked out, what a shame
When only tears know how
To remind us we all break the same

We all break the same
And we all break the same

And everything we've built could be our demise
It's the sticks and stones that wear us down
That often save our lives

And we all freaked out
What a shame
When only tears know how
To remind us we all break the same

We all break the same
And we all break the same

The different stars tonight
Will somehow fade the same
And all the tears we cry
Tell us were made the same
And when we fall aside
Let's hope we fall in place
We built our different lives
But they all break the same

Break the same
Break the same
We all do
We all break the same

And we all freaked out
What a shame
When only tears know how
To remind us we all break the same

And we all break the same
And we all freaked out
What a shame
And we all freaked out
What a shame

All break the same
We all break the same
We all do

And we all break the same
And we all, we all break the same

Oh, different worlds
And different hearts
And different souls
And different parts
And we all, we all break the same

We all break the same
We all break the same

Hello, it's me, your only son
Writing to you now because
I haven't seen you in so long
Even though we live in the same home
You're the father that I've never known
I get up each day, you're already gone
Drive past your office late at night
And see the light still on
Why do you care more about your job
Than about the family falling apart?
Don't even know you
Can't understand you
Never stopped to think of anyone else

Hello, my boy, your letter hurt me so
18 years I've worked so hard,
While I missed seeing you grow
I was just trying to provide for you
All my efforts thrown back in my face
Every morning I say a prayer for you
As I lose another day making it the best for you
Someday you'll wake up and you'll realize
And you'll thank me for how hard I tried
It's always been about you
But I'm a person too
I feel like giving up
I've had about enough
I gave up more for you
Than you'll ever understand
But you were never there for me
When life went bad
Son, I always tried to give you
All the things I never had
But all I ever wanted was a dad

I'm tired of waking up in the same clothes
And the same holes in my skin
The same notes in the same hair
And the same words to the same songs in my head

I heard the news today
Billy's gone away
Left us all for good
No one understood

You only had to say
I would understand
You only had to say
Whatever come what may

I was feeling low
You called and you were too
We'd meet Saturday
It happened on Wednesday

You only had to say, it's sad
I would understand
You only had to say
Whatever come what may

I don't want you brave
A truce we made today
If you're feeling sad
On me you can depend

You only have to say, it's sad
I would understand
You only have to say, it's sad
Whatever come what may

You only had to say
I would understand
Don't be scared to say
Whatever come what may

You only have to say
You only have to say

Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems,
Better put 'em in quotations

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Walking like a one man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead,
If you could only

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You'd better know that in the end
Its better to say too much
Then never say what you need to say again

Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say
Say what you need to say, say what you need to say

Broken, why concede?
Broken, crumbling with grief
Broken, I don't believe you're broken

You've given up, turned it in on yourself now
Not inward out but outward in
And what's the point? You can't be bothered
To be consoled, to be absolved

You're broken, fingers bleed
Broken, porcelain in pieces
Broken, your head between my knees
Broken

You've given up, turned it in on yourself now
Not inward out but outward in
And what's the point? You can't be bothered
To be consoled, to be absolved

You're broken, so broken
Broken, so broken

By a cowardly embrace
It was sealed with a kiss
By a charmer's face

A dissonance wraps its scarf of tatters
About your face, your haunted face
And in disgust, you turn dejected
Can't be consoled, can't be absolved

You're broken, crippled in a heap
Broken, dreams that you won't sleep
Broken, a beggar in the streets
Broken

A dissonance wraps its scarf of tatters
About your face, your haunted face
And in disgust, you turn dejected
Can't be consoled, can't be absolved

Broken, broken
Broken, broken

Ain't much for promises
But I'm a fool for your sweet caress
Don't mean to be obsessed
But all that I can do is guess

And when I miss you
I try to keep my head
But when I kiss you
My heart speaks out instead

Say do you say, won't you say you love me
Say do you say, that you need me still
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will

And if it's someone else
I'd rather be just by myself
Your honesty would help
Right now it seems so hard to tell

Don't wanna worry
But is our love alive
I'm in a hurry
My feelings I can't hide

Say do you say, won't you say you love me
Say do you say, that you need me still
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will

Faithfully yours my love is real, babe
If that is what you want then I'll be there
'Cause I feel so sure this is the real thing
My heart with you will stay, yeah

Say do you say
Say do you say
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will

And when I miss you
I try to keep my head
'Cause when I kiss you
My heart speaks out instead

Say do you say, won't you say you love me
Say do you say, that you need me still
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will

Say do you say, won't you say you love me
Say do you say, that you need me still
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will

Say do you say
Say do you say
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will
Say do you say, won't you say you love me

The requested track is not viewable.

There was a man from Allentown
Who fed his son to death.
He calmly watched him gorge himself
Until his final breath.

And there he stood surprised and shocked
Above his tiny frame.
He said "I bear no blame for this;
I only share his name!"

There was a man from Nazareth
The fools at war pervert.
They forged an image of his flesh
To brand on mugs and t-shirts.

They say one day he'll spring to life
To smile and clear your name,
So nail yourself upon the cross
And hang your head in shame

Forever.
This is forever.
This is forever.
This is forever.
This is forever.

You know what they say when they say - you got it coming to you
(Only in a matter of time will it come to you)
And then you're faced with the choice - I guess to give your love
(It's only when you're ready to do it)
It's just a point of the game - you've gotta push it to you
(Opening the spirit in your heart)

And now you're finally convinced - it will work for you
I guess that's what they try to say to you
(Na si ma wU, Na si mEndE pE tU milla munE mundi)
To you, to you, to you
(Na si ma wU, Na si mEndE pE tU milla munE mundi)
And you, and you, and you
(Na si ma wU, Na si mEndE pE tU milla munE mundi)
To you, to you, to you

They say it's better to be blind - to see what really happens
(I don't believe that for one minute)
I'm just a cog in the wheel - I twist and then I turn
(Anyway is better than no way at all)
Please tell me where are you now - an independent feeling
(You imagine what you want to be)
You've grown so tall in your world - begin to see the light
I guess that's what they try to say to you
To you, to you, to you

I can rely on your love - to help me through tomorrow
(Only if you want to be alive)
Alive and clear as it can be - I want you on my side
(Only if you promise to be true)
I do reach out for the time - to make it all better
(Better than forever really to be yeah)
So now the game is coming clear - clearer into view

I guess that's what they try to say to you
To you, to you, to you
(Na si ma wU, Na si mEndE pE tU milla munE mundi)
And you, and you, and you
(Na si ma wU, Na si mEndE pE tU milla munE mundi)
To you, to you, to you
(Na si ma wU, Na si mEndE pE tU milla munE mundi)

Say, have you ever been down, wished you had just a fin?
Say, have you seen the ground, wonder where you've been?
Say, I betcha don't know, I can tell your kind.
Say, you wouldn't try to go, 'fraid to blow your mind.

You ride a little, hide a little, close your eyes and sigh a little.
Guard your mind and hide a little. Say, can'tcha hear me say?
Say, can you see the light bleedin' through the shade?
Say, are you readin' me right, or are you too afraid?

Say, take a bit of a look, tell me what you think you see.
Say, have you ever been took? You're lookin' like you ought to be.
You ride a little, hide a little, close your eyes and sigh a little.
Guard your mind and hide a little. Say, can'tcha hear me say?

Let me guide you through the story of a boy and his curse
Tiny diamond in his stroller with his first step chasing the hearse
Sippin' at a cup that's half way filled
But looking forward to the day he pays that drinking bill

There's no peace, there's no quiet on this earth
He confided, nestled tightly in that womb beneath the dirt
Hurt no more and when he turned 24
He wrote a note to nail to God's front door that said

I want death
Death for my birthday
I want death
Death in the worst way
I want death
Death for my birthday

Don't get me wrong cause..

I love life
But life has a boyfriend
Bless my soul
I'm out to destroy them
I want death
Death for my birthday

For my birthday

From the high paying job and the love of his life
He rode a roller coaster ride of lust on their wedding night
They made a baby in unmentionable ways
He was ungrateful as a man could be on that blessed day

And underneath he thought this is all a phase
Just a blip in the existence of a structure vast and great
Pray each night to his cross of a charm
For the one thing he couldn't afford just to buy the farm

I want death
Death for my birthday
I want death
Death in the worst way
I want death
Death for my birthday

Don't get me wrong cause..

I love life
But life has a boyfriend
Bless my soul
I'm out to destroy them
I want death
Death for my birthday

For my birthday

I'll never lose another friend again
Or watch them start a war that's fought for ideals that are dead
I'll never have an argument again

Because my dust
Will be your salt
My blood will hydrate you off
My heart will be your meal
And I won't ride the cycle of the way it kills to think and feel
No more, no

I want death
Death for my birthday
I want death
Death in the worst way
I want death
Death for my birthday

Don't get me wrong cause..

I love life
But life has a boyfriend
Bless my soul
I'm out to destroy them
I want death
Death for my birthday

For my birthday

One sweet day his heart ceased to beat
He fell so fast beneath all our feet
Through bugs and snakes
Last words he had to say were

Help me claw my way to the surface
Oh sweet lord you know I deserve this
Just one more, just one more birthday

Pupil swells in sin / adoring a picture
Bending waist let's in / the view is new
Isolate but

Hold your breath until you feel it
Tighten up now, close your eyes
And tell yourself she's only just begun
Then move slow, take a breath and start again

Smells like something clean / over and under
Liquid slowly speaks / in native tongue
Isolate but

Hold your breath until you feel it
Tighten up now, close your eyes
And tell yourself she's only just begun
Then move slow, take a breath and start again

And you'll know / when she knows
If you notice the trembling below

Introduction slips into light conversation
Sinks into slight shouts then escalates
And escalates but

Hold your breath until you feel it
Tighten up now, close your eyes
And tell yourself she's only just begun
Then move slow, take a breath and start again

I love to hear you say that you love me
With words so sweet
And I love the way with just one whisper
You tell me everything
And when you say those words
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it

I love all the ways that you show me
You'll never leave
And the way your kisses, they always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
And I love the love your touch conveys

[Repeat CHORUS]

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it, say it

And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me

[Repeat CHORUS]

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it

Learn to say the same thing
Let us hold fast to sayin' the same thing
I hope all is well with you
I wish the best for you
When no one is around love will always love you

Learn to say the same thing
What defeats people is a double confession
One time they will confess one thing
And the next they will confess something else
Talk to them they will say

Learn to say the same thing
Let us hold fast to saying the same thing
Never give up no never give up
If you're looking for something easy
You might as well give it up
Never give up no never give up
If you're looking for something easy
You might as well give it up

One time they will confess one thing
And the next they will confess the next
Talk to them they will say

Learn to say the same thing
Let us hold fast to saying the same thing

Gone are the days when I was young and free
The future I can't see
Gone are the days of precious love
Relied on, and leaned on
So many days of sleepless nights
By your side
And why oh why
I never thought that it would be like this
My first love the last time

But if he say say says that he loves me (say that you love me) I can cry, I can smile
But if he say say says that he needs me (say that you need me)
There's a light, there's a light
A light for me

Say

So many things that I would like to say
But he took you, took you away
So many things I'd like to ask
It's no good, 'cause you're not here
I hear your voice (I hear your voice) I see you laugh
And if only you were here
You see the night and I the day
But sometime we'll walk away

But if he say say says that he loves me (say that you love me) I can cry, I can smile
But if he say say says that he needs me (say that you need me)
There's a light, there's a light
A light for me

(Never want to feel that way again
That again
Never want to feel that again
Lean on, gonna rely on
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Lean on (lean on), gonna rely on (rely on)
Don't leave me (leave me), don't leave me (leave me)
Lean on (lean on)) Gone are the days when (gonna rely on (rely on)) I was young and free
(Don't leave me (leave me), don't leave me (leave me))
(Lean on (lean on) Gone are the days of (gonna rely on (rely on)) precious love
Relied on (don't leave me (leave me)), and leaned on (don't leave me (leave me))

But if he say say says that he loves me (say that you love me) I can cry, I can smile
But if he say say says that he needs me (say that you need me)
There's a light, there's a light
Yeah,if he say say says that he loves me (say that you love me) I can smile
But if he say say says that he needs me (say that you need me)
There's a light, there's a light

A light for me (say)

So many things I would like to add, he took you away, took you away

Did you know that there are people in the world
Annoyed with all the other people in the world
And of all these angry people in the world
I am the angriest boy

when I was sat into the earth in a stream of guts
By mother nature that green eyed slut
I wasent the first to get forced from a cut
One to whom I still shall stay stuck
Staring from the cradle my eyes take in
The baby speak of my brain dead kin
To goo goo googles reflecting the grin
Of a chubbed faced alien
Well if you think I'm being harsh
Well baby keep on counting stars

cause I hate everyone
I hate everyone
I hate everyone
Upon this cursed earth

then I grew a few hairs where the sun don?t shine
Pack me in a classroom to count the time
Studying the history of mens minds
Chasing tail and committing hate crimes
Rich hippy girl with the gas guzzler
Forced myself to fall in love with her
She was so strung out she swear it never occurred
The honkey king went back on his word
The next one did the same
The blind leading the lame

all together now
I hate everyone
I hate everyone
I hate everyone
Upon this cursed earth

how does it make you feel to be wanted (whoa)
How does it make you feel to be one of many
How does it make you feel to be blunted
How does it make you feel (2x)

(i hate) actors who seem genuine
(i hate) my x girlfriend though she?s feminine
(i hate) the singer with the denim shit

I hate everyone

(i hate) that hospital in texas
(i hate) the rapper in the lexus
(i hate) the pills I ate for breakfast

hate everyone
I hate everyone
I hate everyone
I hate everyone
I hate everyone
Cause admired in hypocrisy
Yeah I'm still down with jc
I guess that everyone includes me
And that's why I'm a humanist
YEAH

Life is not a spark in space
An episode of Will & Grace
Controversial yet mundane
Debra's messing with your brain

Even scientologists
Know there's more to all of this
Search the ruins for trap doors
Wonder what you're put here for

Simple as a hint of gas
Climbing nostrils as you pass
Making Harvard graduates feel childish when they laugh at it

Climb the rungs to kingdom come
Sour patch to acid tongue
Are you opposed to having fun you clench the world between your bun

You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)
You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)

Your life is always the post of something else
Where's the present?
The way that you present yourself
And it's disgusting how little that you try
The existential equivalent of pink eye

Drink alone and watch TV
Your'e expecting harmonies
To tap yout tune with silver spoons
The anthem of impending doom

Guiding Satan's steady hand
Forcing Beatles to disband
It's eco-freaks and drama queens
The young at heart know what I mean

You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)
You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)

You could do better
Better than that
You're a fraud
Thank god you learnt to keep your shirt on
You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world

You burn so brightly
You burn so brightly in the dark
You burn so brightly
You burn so
You burn so

You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)
You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)

You could do better
Better than that
You're a fraud
Thank god you learnt to keep your shirt on
You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)
You could do better
You could do better
You could be the greatest man in the world (woah!)
We could do better
We could do better
We could be the greatest band in the world (woah!)

Never thought that I could feel such a slap in the face
Since my semester in New York where I drank it away
Social strategies were taught to bohemian crowds
And my love was like a food stamp handing it out

Oh then I fell in love with you all faded grizzled and mature
You left me naked pining whining on your bathroom floor
If it makes you jealous, tell us just which boy we should adore
And then we talk about myself so I don't mind that he's a bore

[Chorus]
He's like a less cute version of you, but he'll have to do
He's like a Wal-Mart version of you, but he'll have to do
Have to do

Mountain man brag about your band to me
You've got me hot with all those snide remarks about my poetry
But he gobbles up every single line about the stars
And how they scar my slightly chubby arms like brightly lit cigars

[Chorus x2]

Every time I see your face, I die inside
Every time I see your face, I die inside

There are babies with guns beheading their friends
In shopping malls around the world
Yet somehow the Kings of Leon still find time to write songs about girls
I don't suck much less
At least those dudes have no illusions of angst and hopelessness
And if I claim revolutionary or I give to charity
They'll all know it's a plea for someone like me
Disgusted with lies and cut down by their own beatnik poetry
I'm just one man with no face and no friends
God in this dank Brooklyn bar I can feel it again
It's eating me

Wait a second
I can't write the same damn song over and over again

I can't define myself through irony and self deprecation
I can't deny myself being alive through my alienation

Everything that you do
Keeps me running back to you
Can't give up, live the dream
Even if I don't believe
But we can't afford to surrender
We can't afford

Fake players and the twisted web they weave, oh
I contend that the coming holocaust
Will be of those who choose to believe
In anything but a phallic sense of self
Hang alone in the attic, tied up tightly with your father's belt

You bathe in blood like mister Crowley
Your cost, their loss. Their memory haunts me
I stand opposed to chaos that you chose
New heart, new bones
Am I not alone?

Fake players are the ones who play the game
Fake players are the ones who play the game
Fake players are the ones who play the game
Fake players are the ones who play the game

When I was eight years old
Before puberty took hold
I thought I'd
End up beside a princess bride
And love was indivisible
Never mind how my taste reflects
A disturbing Oedipal complex
It's not awkward girl
The compliments are coming next

You're no witch, you're no wench,
You're like Bjork with better fashion sense
A phone, 50 cents, and I'm building up my confidence
Respect to your work, you're an artist,
I'm a silly jerk
I think that dynamic could work
So work it

I have a total crush on you, baby
And I can't let it go, oh no
I have a total crush on you baby, baby!
If only I could let you know

When we spoke no joke
I started shedding slutty girls
Like snake skin, my collection
Acquired through shallow misdirection
And as I drive tonight
West coast sky
Daring me to try
I feel alive tonight
Possibility, that I'm your guy
Though I suffer from dyslexia,
Mild man-orexia
And my hair cannot commit
To one popular genre of music
And though they all claim,
That a girl can't take a boy's last name
Or end up divorced and estranged
I'm counting on you

I have a total crush on you, baby
And I can't let it go, oh no
I have a total crush on you baby, baby!
If only I could

Your other suitors are no poets
They're only actors who can play guitar
Have I won your heart?
They're not students or screenwriters
They're only models that they taught to read
Love would you agree?

I have a total crush on you, baby
And I can't let it go, oh no
I have a total crush on you baby, baby!
If only I could

Quite sure you love me, Sherri
Quite sure I love you too
We should make a verbal agreement to only to kiss each other
Cause one time, beneath the sky, outside my new york pigsty
I saw a vision of you and I! haha!

Did it hurt? Did it hurt? Did it hurt,
When you fell from heaven girl?
Did it hurt? Did it hurt? Did it hurt,
When you fell from heaven girl?
La da-da da-da da-da, la da-da da-da
La da-da da-da da-da, la da-da da-da

There's a cemetery deep below the sea
They're the spaces reserved for fools like me
Tried to kill myself at least a dozen times
But nothing seemed to turn out right

Now I'd rather wait a half a century
Soiling the bed all belligerent and wrinkly
Even when I go blind and lose my mind
Nothing seems to turn out right
Something's gotta turn out right

If you want then when we die
We'll ascend to someplace way up high
At the gate, they'll show you through
If they ask me, I'm with you

You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where I think about you
(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where I think about you

There's no one who imagines like you
So convinced there's somewhere that we go to
Not a first class trip to the abyss
Tell me, do you still feel this?
Tell me, do you still feel this?

As I drown in lakes of fire
I will call your name as I expire
It's the last thing that I'll do
I will tell them I'm with you

You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where I think about you
(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where...

Falling asleep, asleep at the wheel
As I approach that cliff, I'm starting to feel
If you could wake me up with only your touch
I could die with you, life would be enough

Falling asleep, asleep at the wheel
As I approach that cliff, I'm starting to feel
If you could wake me up with only your touch
I could die with you, life would be enough

And I'll face the one who made
My disgusting heart from a lump of clay
Should he ask what got me through
If he asks me, it was you

You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where I think about you
(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where I think about you
(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
You're in my body
You're, you're in my body
You're in my body
That's where I think about you

Life, it's the only thing that you get for free
Free is what we all want to be
Take a walk around the block til you see
Everything you want life to be

Tell your mother, beg your father
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother, don't try to save it
Sooner or later, you will discover
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure, you can't make it
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure, you can't make it

It's the love alive gets that is both
Love it's the only dream in my heart and soul
Easier to dream than it is to cry
When you're in love goodbye

Tell your mother, beg your father
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother, don't try to save it
Sooner or later, you will discover
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure, you can make it
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure, you can't make it

Beg your father
Don't wait don't bother
Sooner or later, you will discover
Tell your mother
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother

You will discover
Tell your mother
Respect your sister
Don't wait don't bother
You will discover
Go thank your mother, thank you father

Life
Will go on without me
Take it and you`ll see it doesn`t matter

Life
I know what your game is
You take it and trade it for another

Life
Before you`re over
I want something to show for all my trouble

Time come on in
I want you back again
Where`re you goin` now?
I thought you`d know somehow...

Life
If you keep goin`
I`ll try to throw in a little love
Life
I can`t do without you
There`s something about you that keeps me goin`

Life
I don`t want to stop now
I`ve been through so much now because of you

Tell me life... what are you here for?
Tell me life... I want to know more
Tell me life... what are we here for?

Everyday I realize that this might be the last day of my life
Walkin' down the streets I find
I'm comin' closer and closer to losin' my mind
'Cause when it rains it pours, isn't life worth more?
I don't even know what I'm hustlin' for
You gotta do what you gotta do
Just to make it through
All the hard times that's gonna face you

This is the life
Striving to survive
This is the life
Striving to survive
This is the life

Livin' will always be a struggle
Lookin' for someone true to love you
Lookin' back I see all the horrors
This madness makes me wanna hide
I watch slowly, internally I'm dyin'
Pillow case wet from all my cryin'
'Cause there is nothin' more to be here for
Take me away I can't live that life no more

This is the life
Strivin' to survive
This is the life
Strivin' to survive
This is the life
Strivin' to survive
This is the life
Strivin' to survive

Tryin' to get over
Goin' to get over
This is my life
This is my life
This is my life
This is my life

Ooh, la la la.
La la la la la.

Ev'ry day I realize that
this might be the last day of my life
Walking down the street, I find, yeah,
I'm coming closer to losing my mind.
'Cause when it rains, it pours;
isn't life worth more?
I don't even know what I am hustlin' for.
You've got to do what you've got to do
just to make it through
all the hard times that's gonna pace you.

This is the life, striving to survive.
This is the life, striving to survive.
This is the life.

Livin' will always be a struggle,
lookin' for someone true to love you.
Lookin' back, I see all the hard roads.
This madness makes me wanna hide.
I work slowly, eternally. I'm dying.
Pillowcase is wet from all my crying.
There is nothing more to be here for.
Take me away; I can't live that life no more.

This is the life, striving to survive.
This is the life, striving to survive.
This is the life.

This is the life, striving to survive.
This is the life, striving to survive.
This is the life.

Tryin' to get over.
Tryin' to get over.
Tryin' to get over.
Tryin' to get over.
Tryin' to get over.

Life
Will go on without me
Take it and you'll see
It doesn't matter

Life
I know what your game is
You take it and trade it
For another

Life
Before you're over
I want something to show for
All my troubles

Time, come on in
I see you're back again
Where you going now?
I thought you'd know somehow

Life
If you keep going
I'll try to throw in
A little love

There's something about you
That keeps me going

I've been through so much now
Because of you

Tell me, life
What are you here for?
Tell me, life
I wanna know more
Tell me, life
What are we here for?

Life, life
Clouds and clowns
You don't have to come down

Life, woo ooo, life, woo ooo
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

You might get angry sometimes
But don't let it turn you around
All you gotta do is get your livin' now

Life, life
Clouds and clowns
You don't have to come down

You might be scared of somethin' look at Mr. Stewart
He's the only person he has to fear
He'd only let himself get near

He don't trust nobody
If he stopped bein' so shady
He could have a nice young lady

Life, life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

You're gonna be sad sometimes
You might wake up to find your pet is gone
But maybe, he's tired of bein' alone

Dog gets hip, it has to go
If you're lovin' you can't be sad no more

Life, life
Clouds and clowns
You don't have to come down

Life, woo ooo, life, woo ooo
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

Listen baby, ain't no mountain high,
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough;
Baby if you need me call me no matter where you are,
No matter how far;
Just call my name;  I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,

'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe.

Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me,
Some way, some how.

'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe.

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand,
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can.
Don't you know that there

Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe.

No wind no rain or winters cold can stop me baby,
'Cause you are my goal.
If you're ever in trouble;
I'll be there on the double.
Just send for me, oh baby.

If you need me call me no matter where you are,
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,

'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe.

Life, you have been good to me
Life, have you chosen me
To give your blessings too?

Life, you served your finest wine
I drank it down to find
My glass was always full

Life, sometimes you made me sad
Although I always had the very best
A friendship, love and happiness

Tonight I raise my glass to you
I hope that I've been true
To life

And yes, you served your finest wine
I drank it down to find
My glass was always full

Life, sometimes you made me sad
Although I always had the very best
A friendship, love and happiness

And now it's all been said and done
I dedicate this song
To life

Somebody give me a sign,
That everything's going as planned,
And then everything falls away,
Into the darkness of this shallow place.
The detail is striking,
The room's cold and frightening,
You'll kick and you'll scream,
You'll try everything to survive,
But you should know your fate by now.

They told me (they told me)
How I should be,
But I broke the mold somehow!

It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now,
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done to me.

You, you know you gotta assert yourself,
Leave what you need for now,
It's not the time or place you're searching for.
All I can give them's my worst of intentions.
You're nothing to me and everyone can see that
Your life's a lie, there's nowhere left to hide.

They told me (they told me)
How I should be,
But I broke the mold somehow!

It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now,
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done

It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now,
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done

Watch your back, you'll lose yourself!
This is a battleground!
When will they know,

Your life's a lie.

It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now,
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done

It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now,
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done

They told me (they told me)
How I should be,
But I broke the mold somehow!





My mind is under an attack,
although no one sees
My past is pounding in the back of my memories
It's always there to poison my mind with all I do
Feelings I know so well seem to come back
as if nothing's ever changed

Fear was one of the reasons to crawl away into a world I lost
I know the rules,I play the game
but somehow it always stays the same
In spite of my will,in spite of my hope,in spite of it all

So for those who believe in this life,
spand right on this circle-must be round
Every turn has its vortex,you'll drown if nobody warns you
and shows you another circle of life

Nothing will change,
nothing is done for the victim I am forced to remain
Cause these days make you feel,and you are,on your own

Study,work hard,marry,reproduce and become the perfect model
Can you stand the test of time if life is a vicious circle
without the mirror of another path

So for those who believe in this life
stand right on the circle-must be round
Every turn has its vortex,you'll drown if nobody warns you
and shows you another circle of life

Yeah my nigga Rule, Hussein Fatal
The outlaw don in this piece motherfucker

It's cool, my new best friend is my pistol
And anybody that want it or got jewels run it
And end over your head, don't make me gun butt it
Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach
And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin' my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin' up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the "Inc." is "Murderous"
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips
Murder meets gangsta shit
And all my niggas that live it from hood to hood bang to this, nigga

The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your Blood or cause we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs

I'm the street's poster child
I'm supposed to wile
With the toast I'm foul
My Murder Inc. mob money, Oprah style
From here back to the block, they get that green
Known to put a hole through a nigga's shoulder soon as the beam glow
Probably graze you in the face, give me a break
I'ma rapper, out here to stay, don't make me do what I say
Just let me say what I do
Cause I'ma put it in a rhyme, every time, about to spray up your crew
And I ain't lickin' off shots to warn 'em
Just a pop swift to the dome, on the real "G-Unit" nigga, glock and all this
So believe I'm not the one when it get stupid in the booth
I told y'all with Rule it was a gun in this bitch
Now I expose how scary you niggas is
And when you want the bis
My brick city outlaws' a bury you niggas
I'm so cool, when I ain't doin' my numbers
Let the

Okay, motherfuckers when the bounce came to your waist
And shells get to droppin'
You better duck, and get up poppin'
Don't get left with the cops
Gangsta, yeah, put that work in
Put a nigga dick in the dirt
Lace shots to the face
Hopin' it shut case, John Doe
Unidentified, I always hit 'em high when I dump and let it fly
Now once with 45 nigga I had a picture on top of the coffin
Murder Inc. bosses

The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your Blood or cause we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your hoein' or stuck up, we're still gon' fuck
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Niggas don't want it with us, cause it's Murder

Okay you hard as fuck
But when the slug hit, you dead if your name ain't armored truck
Murder Inc., Outlawz and the Floys is here
Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, cowboys is near
Stampedin' anythin' in our way, we'll attract war
If your smart you'll slide over like handicap doors
I ain't a killer, I just spark a lot
So when I squeeze I'm turnin' your whole block to a parking lot
Understand I'm the grimy Floy
Wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since '94, that's why cats don't hang around me like Chinese stores
One step ahead of you, get more guys
You strapped with four fours, we pack four fives
Fuck talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if your able to crawl or walk out

I'm in the pop life
So when I pop up in your life, and I pop twice
Get down, I spits more than rounds
And niggas bleed heavier than hoes on they period
This sound gotta movin' "Faster Than Furious"
But nah I ain't Ludacris
I'm here to let y'all niggas know I ain't new to this
Gun butt your bitch
That's the way I get down, believe my style is Murder
Clap a nigga, dipped and hide the burner
The rule to learn ya bomb ya like embalming fluid
Until your limbs feel a loss of movement
In the hospital in critical livin'
Must minimal (who done it?) it's Murder
Yeah, that's subliminal
Who gets down and bangs with nothin' but criminals (c'mon, c'mon)
Rule nigga you know it, these others cats is pitiful
Bein a rap God is spiritual
Your God is Ja Rule nigga let's not get it confused, haha

The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your Blood or cuz we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your hoein or stuck up, we're still gon' fuck
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Niggaz don't want it with us, cause it's Murder

The life, the life

Somewhere out in empty space,
long before the human race,
Something stirred,
A vast and timeless source began,
Intelligence was born and then,
there was the world,
Powers filled the universe,
matter formed and broke the curse,
Of nothingness,
Love became an ageless soul,
nature reached her highest goal,
And breathed the breath of life,
Everlasting life.

Well creatures come from out of sight,
Daylight came from in the night,
and all was good,
Life became a masterplan,
Love produced the perfect man,
that understood,
The image of the makers word,
worshipped him with all he had,
But then one day,
From in the depths an evil seed,
grew and manufactured greed,
That changed the way of life,
Everlasting life,

Oh the loving power looked and saw,
Inside the heart of man a flaw,
began to grow,
Well, the fires of hell began to burn,
and so he sent his chosen son,
To let us know,
That love had surely made us all,
and hate would surely make us fall,
So from the cross,
Well he showed the world that dreadful day,
That love could be the only way,
or all is lost of life,
Everlasting life,
For life is love,
And love is life.





Oh what a change
Has come over me
My life has detoured
A life of misery
From darkness
You gave me light
All the wrong in my life
You came and made it right

He has given us new life
He has given us new life

He has given us new life
He has given us new life

He has given us new life

New life
New life
New life
He's given us new life

He has given us new life

Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past life is real
Life is real, life is real, so real

Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel - life is real
Life is real, life is real, oh yeah

Success is my breathing space
I brought it to myself
I will price it
I will cash it

I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say

I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
Life is real, life is real, life is real

Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore

Life is real, life is real, life is real, so real
Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real - so real

But I'm drapped like a nigga movin' kilo

Shit don't stop

Make the front pop
And hit the three wheel motion

All day
Hit the freeway
Take it easy, uh

And pick-up some hoochies
Ride right back to the movies
High talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer, I'm livin' that

But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at Mophreme

Tell 'em why the hoes dream
Gettin' high off a nigga like a dope fiend

Twenty four seven, ain't nothin' buck

But when a young G's flippin' keys for a livin'

Life
Have I accomplished anything,
have I caused anyone to sing
A happy song?

Life
I've lived it every day
I've lived it every way
Though some of it was wrong

Some of it's been fast
I've lived a happy past
I don't regret a thing you see
After all is said and done,
I've lived each moment one by one
Life's been good to me

Life
If I have caused on tear to fall
It was unknown
Life
If there are tears that must fall yet
I pray that, life, you'll let them be my own
I've enjoyed it as I should
And every day of its been good
Since life began
So when it comes time for the end
I'd like to live it all again
'Cause life you've been my friend

I've enjoyed it as I should
And every day of its been good since life began
So when it comes time for the end
I'd like to live it all again
'Cause life you've been my friend.

Sea shells raise hell to the soles of my feet
Why don't you open your minds to the sweet?
I tripped and fell down...

Falling down deeper, down deeper within
Love me and I'll love you so make love to me
I tripped and fell down...

Falling down deeper, falling down deeper, deeper
There's only one way to fall
Life's an illusion, lost in seclusion
Life can be groovy tasty to all

I tripped and fell down...

Batten down the hatch
'Cause we're all coming in
Like uninvited guests
Romancing everything
Keep your hands away
From what you can't afford
We don't think that we'll stay
Now that you look bored

God only knows
What Brian Wilson meant
Pick out your clothes
With some real intent
You don't seem to care
That I've been waiting here
Pulling out my hair
For you to come
My dear

I'll go all the way
As long as you go first
Running all this way
Has given me a thirst
Believe in what you want
As long as you can see
What's right in front of you
I guess that that's just me

God only knows
What Brian Wilson meant
Pick out your clothes
With some real intent
You don't seem to care
That I've been waiting here
Pulling out my hair
For you to come
My dear

You run your life, like a snake in the grass
With your 42nd wife
Do you know who you are
Your mouth moves fast but you never go far

Stand up, say what you want
Take the money and run
You've got the gun to your head
But you're busy having fun
You read like a book
A hero within cause you killed another crook

Stand up, say what you want
Now you sit in a crowd
And you woke from a dream
Cause the clock's too loud

Stand up, say what you want
Stand up, say what you want

Listen to my tale of woe,
It's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all-alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh lady be good to me.

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

[Chorus]

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me like a lady
You ain't got my lovin' yet
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me with respect
Or my love you'll never get

Hey, Mr. Big Shot, what you putting down
Lately when I need you, you're nowhere to be found
(What you putting down)
I heard it through the grapevine,
You've been cheatin' love
'Cause what you see you ain't got
Until you'll respect my love

I ain't no pushover
I got a bird in the bushes, too
Don't be too over-confident
That bird may not be you

Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me like a lady
You ain't got my lovin' yet
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me with respect
Or my love you'll never get

You're gonna blow a good thing
You think I'm under your thumb
One day you'll snap your finger, and I will fail to come
(You weren't the only one)
You break to your men friends to make yourself look tall
When I leave, they'll laugh at you
And on your knees you crawl

I ain't no pushover
I got a bird in the bushes, too
Don't be too over-confident
That bird may not be you

Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me with respect
Or my love you'll never get

Oh! Oh, oh, oh!
You better treat me like a lady
You better treat me like a lady

Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me like a lady
You ain't got my lovin' yet
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
No, no, no, you better treat me with respect
Or my love you'll never get

When you're alone, and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; don't wait a minute for
Downtown; everything's waiting for you

Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Everybody stops and stares at my baby
When she's walkin' down the street
People passin' by just look at my baby
Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Every time we kiss I get that feelin'
Every time we simply meet
When I see you smile I get that feelin'
Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Never ever know a girl so lovely
Sweet enough to want to eat
Everybody's crazy 'bout my baby
Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

You'd better come home and stop your running around
You'd better come home and get your feet on the ground
Cause I won't share my love with anyone new
You'd better be smart, you've gotta make up your mind
Stop breaking my heart and leave the others behind
Cause I won't share my love whatever I do
The love that I give for as long as I live will be yours
And nothing can change the way that I feel
So, baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Love me like you did before
You'd better come home and see the damage you've done
You'd better come home because you've had all your fun
And I won't share my love with anyone new
No oh no
The love that I give for as long as I live will be yours
And nothing can change the way that I feel
So, baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Love me like you did before
You'd better come home and see the damage you've done
You'd better come home because you've had all your fun
And I won't share my love with anyone new
No oh no
I just want to share it with you
You'd better come home
You'd better come home
You'd better come home

When life doesn't seem worth the living
And you don't really care who you are
When you feel there is no one beside you
Look for a star

When you know you're alone and so lonely
And your friends have traveled afar
There is someone waiting to guide you
Look for a star

Oh everyone has a lucky star
That shines in the sky up above
If you wish on a lucky star
You're sure to find someone to love

A rich man man, a poor man, a beggar
No matter whoever you are
There's a friend who's waiting to guide you
Look for a star

A rich man, a poor man, a beggar
No matter whoever you are
There's a friend who's waiting to guide you
Look for a star.

Every day when the work is behind you
And the shop and the store put the lock on the door
Just get away where your worries won't find you
If you like, well I'll tell you more

Don't let the day get the better of you
When the evening comes there's so much to do
You better put on your best and wear a smile
Just come along with me awhile, 'cause I tell you

I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go

At the door there's a man who will greet you
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there

All around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now 'cause I tell you

[Chorus]

Well, all around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now 'cause I tell you

[Chorus]

I know a place where we can go
I know a place where the lights are low

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Na na na nananana, nannana, hey Jude

'Round every corner, 'round every corner
'Round every corner, 'round every corner
'Round every corner, 'round every corner
'Round every corner, 'round every corner

Stop feeling sad now, life ain't so bad, now
'Round every corner, 'round every corner
While you're debating, somethings awaiting
'Round every corner, 'round every corner

When Columbus sailed away to other shores
How could he imagine all that waited for him

'Round every corner
'Round every corner, 'round every corner

Leave all the blue days, think about the new days
'Round every corner, 'round every corner
Everything is yours, now, open all the doors, now

Man will soon be standing on the moon above
Just imagine all the things that he'll discover

'Round every corner
'Round every corner

You've gotta stop a sittin' there on the shelf
You've gotta start lookin' out for yourself, yeah

'Round every corner, 'round every corner
'Round every corner, 'round every corner
What's the use in crying? Happiness is lying
'Round every corner, 'round every corner
And if you want a true love, look for a new love

Just forget the worries that you leave behind
There are many things to do and you can find them

Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!

You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

Listen to my tale of woe,
It's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all-alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh lady be good to me.

I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

"I love you"
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again

You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, tell you that you're marvelous
Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

Listen to my tale of woe,
It's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all-alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh lady be good to me.

I've got to leave now
Leave this frozen and overcrowded town,
And catch the first train,
Not knowing its destination.
I 'm gazing at people
Each of them, those lifeless things,
As I travel through the
Moody and rainy autumn night.

Metal grates on metal,
The shrilly scream of the
Brakes wake me. People get down,
Staring at me strangely,
I glare at them
And they hasten out,

I can feel vibrations running through my body
As the machine starts again...
All alone in the car,
The last station is near,
I find it empty,
I'm alone with the night.
Guided by the echoes
Of melancholia,
I'm walking up the dimly lit path.

I'm swallowed by the cool
And obscure night,
The wild and cold surroundings
Graze my skin.
Excited by my senses,
I run towards a glade.
Trees in the moonlight thow
Bars upon the ground.

Above me, the full moon is shining
And I shoot a sharp look at it.
My eyes are crying,
How could I resist it?
My throat, freed from its lump,
Utters a long howl.
It's been a long time since
I was no longer Human.

Yes there comes a booming sound
It used to come from underground
Now it emanates
From a kind of welfare state
Of the soul
Yeah baby of the soul

We do not die, we only change
All must die before their rebirth as
Fruit must rot to release its seed
Soul transmigration from divinity to
The mutable world of birth and
Disease, old age and death the breeze
Created by a soul's departure arising
From this dead and lifeless shell we
Emanate from the deceased we do
Not die only change, only change,
Youknow we do not die only change
You know we only change death is the
Dying of the light now the
Imperishable soul begins its journey to
The divine implicit and vague become
Explicit and clear infinitely long
Passage from another world to our
Own the winds of a departing soul
The time of now is slipping away we
Do not die only change, only change

Selfish and stoned
I go through life with hazy eyes
And I gotta crazy idea for a new art project
That I will never do
I'm hung up on what's new

So let the dim light shine
Over my eyes
Let me emanate the dim light
Of an overcast day
In the bleakest of springtime

That I will never change
That I am not changin'
So let the day pass by
Over my eyes

When suddenly I wake up in the present time
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
So what am I gonna do?
I'm hung up on leavin' you

Look for Ocean in the Sky
Like the soft deep of High
In the danger
Goblin will fascinate
Taste it don't be afraid
Leave me easy
If you call me and wait
Does your light emanate
Don't betray me
As wind blows us away
All the more I've to play
May me open
My gleam infernal star
Like me feel who you are
In the fire
I see through Goblin's game
Sky to Earth sticks again
Play with danger
As wind blows us away
Leaving immortals' stay
Don't betray me
You win...You win...

Positive friction, under the upper crust
What does all this Hollywood really have to do with us
True grit, timeless love
There's no reason to pretend
Lets get together and become natural once again
Natural once again

There is a certain vibe, circulating in the air
Cast from all the energy that emanates from everywhere
Ah, such a lovely truth
Beginning to unfold
It's our brothers and sisters
All coming in from the cold...Natural once again

There's a family growing
I've seen it with my own two eyes
There's something that we're all knowing
I hope its spreading like a wild fire
Back to a place one might call home

We have our own heroes
They're dancing in the living room
We're busy, busy counting out from zero
Not one minute too soon
Back to a place one might call home

I just love this part of the world
The food's fine and the sun shines
And the people seem so relaxed
They ride motorbikes lidless
It seems like nobody's ever been anywhere
They didn't wanna be
I guess I'm not long for this world

He just seems to kind of sit there all day long
In his little store
Where time stood still long before
Meticulous man, time on his hands
Time is his hands
He told me
You too can exist in your very own parallel time
Time ticks and how do you get your kicks?
Right now I could do with any kicks

Back home it's another dead cold night
The street lights emanate kind of surreal glows
Upon the real cold driven snow
That we all know so well
And I walk alone
But when there's a song in my head
I don't really feel alone
The busy streets are empty now
And everybody's gone home

In the tower, the lover sighs
"Good sir knight, please take my eyes I've used them."
"Doctor, Doctor, I'm on fire!"
"Oh, I'm sad to hear that, squire
We're closing."
She snuffs you out like silk
And pours you out like milk
But just before the dawn appears, Stealing all the blue away
And just before
All your perspectives change
Isn't it strange?

On the black Fellini sails
Tattered rags that hangs on nails Reminds me
You, the mistress of your chair
I, the sergeant of your hair
You blind me
You turn me on like light
A silver liquid light
That emanates inside of you
Decorates the room around you
Just before the curtains part for dawn
And everything's gone

She had one long pair of eyes
She had one long pair of eyes
Between her
One long pair or eyes
So she could see you

On the lone Norwegian shore
Lovers weep for evermore in evening
With the clouds above their heads
Go back to their lonesome beds
And leave them
She falls on you like rain
When will she fall again?
Oh just before the dawn appears, Draining all the blue away
And just before
All your perspectives change
Isn't that strange?

She had one long pair of eyes
She had one long pair of eyes
Between her
One long pair of eyes
She had one long pair of eyes
Between her
One long pair of eyes
Oh, she had one long pair of eyes Between her
One long pair of eyes
So she could see you

Start with vanity
Arrogance and greed
Panic is my obsession
No one can escape

The thrill is much too great
Despair is my creation
Everything obscene
Emanates from me

Homicide is on the rise
It all begins now
Take your final bow
The camera never lies

Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony

Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

No one else around
Razor wire bound
Insanity is so near
Heart begins to seize

Watch you atrophy
Reality is now clear
Take a look inside
Many more have died

The internet's an open door
Everyone can see
Dying brutally
The audience begs for more

Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony

Captured for eternity

Killing is my future

Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Murder is my future

When you borrowed it that night
You wore my jacket for the last time
The jacket used to be our history
Now its only covered with your cold memory

So much time I spent with you now
Now all that's left are tears from falling off your bed
Marks made by your sleeping head
Lipstick from a drunken kiss
Ice cream stains that now I miss

I read the band names on the clothes
GBH, Black Flag and Dr. Know
I saw the Devo patch on your sleeve
And you were in my jacket without me

So much time I spent with you now
Now all that's left are tears from falling off your bed
Marks made by your sleeping head
Lipstick from a drunken kiss
Ice cream stains that now I miss

Blood from when you scraped your cheek
That dirt from walking by the creek
Coffee spilled on our first date
I used to let you wear it in the rain

So much time I spent with you girl
Now all that's left are tears from falling off your bed
Marks made by your sleeping head
Lipstick from a drunken kiss

Ice cream stains that now I miss
You used to wear it in the rain

Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life

And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day

We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk, don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name

And idolize twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more riders

Well, I can't wait any longer for what I want

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

Yeah, I'll look very real cool when I got that jacket on

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

Oh, I really have styles. Just you wait and see

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

And all of the crew will be looking at me

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

Oh, I'm gonna make a racket till I wear that groovy jacket

I want to wear the jacket. Yeah, I want to wear the jacket

Now everybody knows that the jacket is fine

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

Ho-ho, shiny gold buttons and a naval design

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

Yeah it will really go well with my pirate slacks

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

And I'll be a special captain when I have it on my back

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

Well, I'm gonna make a racket 'till I wear that groovy jacket

So I want to wear the jacket. Yes, I want to wear the jacket

Ho-ho, what a wonderful jacket. Oh, I want to wear that jacket

Well, I'm gonna make a racket until I wear that jacket

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

I want to wear the jacket, I want to wear the jacket

So I want to wear, I want to wear the jacket

I'm gonna make a racket 'till I wear that groovy jacket

'Cause I want to wear the jacket. Yes, I want to the jacket

Ho-ho this is the best jacket I've ever seen, argh!

I remember how it felt we were sittin' on the roof
You were in my black jacket drinkin' up the view
We were Romeo and Juliet smoking Lite cigarettes
All night long

Countin' yellow cabs we were showing tattoos
On top of the world we had nothing to lose
Fallin' like snowflakes crashin' out at your place
What went wrong

If I see you out tonight
You'll think I'm doin' alright
'Cause you can't see
What's underneath this black Jacket is a broken heart and
And I never take it off
'Cause I just can't hang it up
It's too torn apart this
Black jacket has a broken heart

I still use your umbrella when I'm walking in the rain
I cant help but crack a smile every time I hear a train
I never got your music till you left and made me use it
Just to keep you around
It's a small world town

If I see you out tonight
You'll think I'm doin' alright
'Cause you can't see
What's underneath this black Jacket is a broken heart
I never take it off
'Cause I just can't hang it up
It's too torn apart this
Black jacket has a broken heart

One day I'm gonna take it off
Set it up in flames
Oh I won't even hear it, when somebody says your name
Nothing left to hide
I won't even hurt
Yeah, I'll be alright in a white T-shirt, but
If I see you out tonight

If I see you out tonight
You'll think I'm doin' alright
'Cause you can't see
What's underneath this black Jacket is a broken heart and
I never take it off
'Cause I just can't hang it up
It's too torn apart this
Black jacket has a broken heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And she's got safety pins and string holding it together
She can only wear her jacket in warm weather
Although the sleeves need to be shortened
The fact that the arms are falling off isn't important

(Because) Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart
Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart

The lining in her coat is rotten
And it seems that the zipper has been completely forgotten
She had a dollar ten for a slice in the pocket of the right
But the pocket had a hole and she looked for the change all night

Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart
Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart

This is a list of malformations
But it would cost one hundred dollars for alterations
We all know that the pressed leather is in
But you can't keep warm in the winter in December
In the city when it's 32 degrees below zero
With a safety pin!

Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart
Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart
Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Is falling apart
Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket, Jennifer's jacket,
Falling apart at the seams!
Falling apart at the seams!
Falling apart at the seams!
Falling apart at the seams! (Jennifer's jacket is)
Falling apart at the seams! (Jennifer's jacket is)
Falling apart at the seams! (Jennifer's jacket is)
Falling apart at the seams! (Jennifer's jacket is)
Falling apart at the seams, yeah!

I wore a black leather jacket way back in high school
And man, lookin back at these pictures of us, we were so cool
You were so hot in your pink lipstick
Painted on the end of a lit cigarette
And I loved you girl, yeah, I loved you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight
You wore it in the stands at the football games
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

I know you grew up, I grew up, too
You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too
Thank God they look like you

And every night I put it back it on and Im sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river if you get the shivers, Ill put it around you
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three words, two rings, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

Well, there's nothin in the world makes me feel more alive
When its just you and me and the moon is high
I slip into the sleeves and with your hand in mine
I go back to the night when I fell into your eyes

Two kids just fallin in love
And here we are right now, good heavens above
Its only gettin better, baby
Its only getting better, baby
I just love that black, leather jacket

Coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, letting me go

I just can't look its killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause I'm Mr Brightside

Had a dream that you were in
The leather jacket that didn't fit
Until we split in two

Half of you turned into glue
And half of me latched onto you
Under the summer moon

All for a leather jacket
We were so indecisive
We hadn't really thought it through
'Cause we were so in love then
And things like that don't happen
And things like that don't slip away

But sometimes they do

Waiting, I... I crumbled again
Rising above, I stumbled again
Wearing my full devil jacket again
Keeps me safe in sin
Wearing my full devil jacket again
Keeps me safe in sin
Maybe I don't have that much to say
Maybe things were meant to be that way
Wearing my full devil jacket again
Keeps me safe in sin
Wearing my full devil jacket again
Keeps me safe in sin
Oh, no, I stumbled again
Oh, no, I stumbled again
Jesus wants me back in church again
I'm not ready to give my life back to him
Wearing my full devil jacket again
Keeps me far from him
Wearing my full devil jacket again
Keeps me far from him
Wearing my full devil jacket again

Why, why can't you be happy for me?
Now I've found someone who'll put up with me
I'm no little girl, I'm the woman you raised
I need some answers, you got me fazed
With your prejudice
Was there something I missed
When you told me you love me?

You want me in your straight jacket
You won't accept me without it though
You know it's the one I've outgrown
You want me in your straight jacket
You'll never close me in your brackets
Don't you realise you're out on your own?

Please, please understand my choice
Why you trying to stifle my voice?
I sympathise with the way that you feel
But time stops for no-one
And you're standing still
And nothing grows under a shadow
I'm sorry, it's not my story

You want me in your straight jacket
You won't accept me without it though
You know it's the one I've outgrown
You want me in your straight jacket
You'll never close me in your brackets
Don't you realise you're out on your own?

I'm sorry that my life didn't turn out as you meant
Nothing is an accident
It's all just in the script
It's something to accept
I know you won't admit
You only hurt yourself
I can't do this by myself

'Cause we've been banging our heads
On the same piece of the same wall
At the same time
For far too long now
And nothing lasts forever
So what else is new?
You held us all together
We're all waiting for you

You want me in your straight jacket
You won't accept me without it though
You know it's the one I've outgrown
You want me in your straight jacket
You'll never close me in your brackets
Don't you realise you're out on your own?

You want me in your straight jacket
You won't accept me without it though
You know it's the one I've outgrown
You want me in your straight jacket
You'll never close me in your brackets
Don't you realise you're out on your own?

Woe is me I can't get my bread up when it's so easy
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas
All I need Someone to look out for me

I'm in a Chevy, with the top dropped
I parked both Benzes, but neither's in the shop
I'm on my third Rolex, but show me what's next
And I bet I'll do get it, do it, done it
Dag gone it, I'm a mess
And when I play this guitar
It's goin' make my dick hard
Something like the Scarecrow
Michael Jackson
Fuck the Wizard
I should have gone ?
Bipolar is Julliard
Either extreme, I'll kill you motherfuckers, on the schoolyard
Checks off, in bound
Watch the Quiksta get down
I hate a hacker, Hacker players need to go back
Sit down
Cuz if you ain't with the now
That makes you way back when
And you can keep all of that retro-dated action
Now get up on my time zone
Quit workin' with limestones
Switch that shit for marble and granite
Produced Whitney and Janet
Oh you can't
Nobody else on this planet
It's just me, I'm a plant
And I'm so dope, you can't handle it
I rhyme, and you ramblin'

I rhyme and you ramblin'

Woe is me I can't get my bread up when it's so easy
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas
All I need Someone to look out for me

Yeah, tryna burn somethin'
Buy a lot of books these days

Cars that ain't got no miles
You know my style
See me and be like 'wow'
She so aroused

You know the crown
The all white and black White Sox hat
It's goin' down
Take a nigga shoppin' or somethin'

Told everybody we datin', no we wasn't
We was just havin' some fun, then you tripped
Talkin' that relationship shit

Went to the studio, quick, Got with Quik
Told him 'let me get a 16', made a hit
The O.P.M. money, legit, keep countin'
Last time I made ten records off three ounces
I'ma need a house with a view and three fountains
Just a little something for my niggas to keep bouncin'
Uh, cuz we don't dance much

Aye, ya'll should start doin' stand up
You sold records, pull them scans up
Aye, said my niggas pull them ? up

Sound like he hooked the band up
Suga Free I'm a fan bruh
Aye, this finna fuck the land up
Uh
Cuz it'll neva stop
Your style is like lemonade, it'll neva pop
Everytime you on TV, I don't neva watch

Rest in Peace to Etta James, she's in a better spot
This summer I'm making fur and wearing leather hot

Dj Quik, you're the greatest

I wear my leather jacket like a great big hug
Radiating charm - a living cloak of luck
It's the only concrete link with an absent friend
It's a symbol I can wear 'till we meet again
Or it's a weight around my neck while the owner's free
Both protector and reminder of mortality
It's a curse - I cannot shirk responsibilities
From the teacher to the pupil it's a gift to me
So I love my leather jacket and I wear it all the time
I love my leather jacket

Don't you know it's darkest before the dawn
And this thought keeps me moving on
If we could heed these early warnings
The time is now, quiet early morning

Some say that human kind won't long endure
But what makes them of so sure
I know that you who hear my singing
Can make those freedom bells go on ringing

And so we keep on while we live
Until we have no more to give
And when our fingers can strum no longer
Hand the old banjo to the young ones stronger

So though it's darkest before the dawn
These thoughts keep us moving on
Through all this world of joy and sorrow
We still can have singing tomorrows

There's just one place for me
Near you

It's like heaven to be
Near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart

Say you'll never stay
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent
Near you

I'd be more than content
Near you

Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days
Near you

Near you
Near you
Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days
Near you

Spend the rest of my days
Near you

There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stay
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content, near you

Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Near you, near you
Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Spend the rest of my days near you

I've been watching you from the corner of my eye
I can't stand it, be too close, can't stand it
Be too far and I can't say why, yeah
And as the shadow fades
Where you walk away
My secret's written all across my face

I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, ohh

Oh, I've been watching you from the corner of the sea
You are silent
Eyes of eyes
You are silent
Hands of hands
And I want them both on me
But in the quiet strain
The mention of your name
And I'm running from you
And running to you all the same

I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, oh tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight
Round and round we go
The shadows dance by so slow
But only for me to know

I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, oh tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight, oh tonight
I only want you near me
I only want you near me
Tonight
Hey yeah

I only want you near me

Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine

There's just one place for me
Near you
It's like heaven to be
Near you

Times when we're apart
I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent
Near you
I'd be more than content
Near you

Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days
Near you

If my hours could be spent
Near you
I'd be more than content
Near you

Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days
Near you

I'll spend the rest of my days
Near you
Spend the rest of my days
Near you (and fade)

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too.
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear,
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

There's just one place for me
 Near you

 It's like heaven to be
 Near you

 Times when we're apart
 And I can't face my heart

 Say you'll never stay
 More than just two lips away

 If my hours could be spent
 Near you

 I'd be more than content
 Near you

 Make my life worth while
 By telling me that I'll
 Spend the rest of my days
 Near you

  near you - near you
 Make my life worth while
 By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days
 Near you

 Spend the rest of my days
 Near you

Sit beside the breakfast table
Think about your troubles
Pour yourself a cup of tea
Then think about the bubbles

You can take your teardrops
And drop 'em in a teacup
Take 'em down to the riverside
And throw 'em over the side

To be swept up by a current
Then taken to the ocean
To be eaten by some fishes
Who were eaten by some fishes

And swallowed by a whale
Who grew so old he decomposed
He died and left his body
To the bottom of the ocean

Now everybody knows
That when a body decomposes
The basic elements
Are given back to the ocean

And the sea does what it oughta
And soon there's salty water
Which is not to good for drinkin'
Cause it tastes just like a teardrop

So we run it through a filter
And it comes out from a faucet
Where it pours into a teapot
Which is just about to bubble
Now think about your troubles

Don't you know it's darkest before the dawn
And this thought keeps me moving on
If we could heed these early warnings
The time is now, quiet early morning

Some say that human kind won't long endure
But what makes them of so sure
I know that you who hear my singing
Can make those freedom bells go on ringing

And so we keep on while we live
Until we have no more to give
And when our fingers can strum no longer
Hand the old banjo to the young ones stronger

So though it's darkest before the dawn
These thoughts keep us moving on
Through all this world of joy and sorrow
We still can have singing tomorrows

Near to you, near to you
Even though you're far away
So near to you, always near to you
As near as April is to may
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair
Staring at the fireplace?
Oh so near to you, always near to you
Even now it seems we're face to face
But it is just if though I was standing before you
Telling you how much I adore you
If I'm really dear to you, near to you
We may be far apart and yet
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart
How near to you can I get
(2x)

Oh so near to you, always near to you
As near as April is to may
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair
Staring at the fireplace?
Oh so near to you, always near to you
Even now it seems we're face to face
But it is just if though I was standing before you
Telling you how much I adore you
If I'm really dear to you, near to you
We may be far apart and yet
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart
How near to you can I get?

How near to you can I get?
How near to you, can I get?

It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day.
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.

It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be, near you
Times when we're apart
I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content near you
Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days near you

There is just one place for me, I'm happy when I'm near you
It's wonderful as heaven, a special kind of heaven, but only when I'm near you
Times when we're apart I wonder how I can face my heart
Say you'll never stray
More than just two lips away

If my waking hours could be spent while near you
I would be content, wonderfully content, just to be near you
Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days
All of those happy, happy days
So near you
