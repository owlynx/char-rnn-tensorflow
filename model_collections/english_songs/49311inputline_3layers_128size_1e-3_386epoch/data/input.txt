As a child you would wait
And watch from far away.
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play.

In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change,
But it was just a dream!

Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Will come
When you'll have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself,
Your spirit never dies!

Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.

Maybe I'm broken
Maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should have
Only the good die old
That's what they told me
But I don't know, whoa

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep
To the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to
Drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold
And crumble away

Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason
Breaking me down to my knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light, oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep
To the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to
Drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold
And crumble away

I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you

I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you

I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my

About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder stopped in cold to read
No time
Get mine and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry

No lies and no deceiving, that is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that death is from above
No time
I get by and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a

A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry

Life isn't always what you think it'd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll
Make it up to you somehow, somehow

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word dream maker, life taker

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
Disappear dream maker, life taker

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

I want to believe

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

First comes the blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real
Who can you trust?
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

Statues and empires are all at your hands,
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turnin' stale and its cold,
Oh you'll no longer fear when your heart's turned to gold
Who can you trust
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

I'm dying to feel again,
Oh anything at all,
But oh I feel nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' at all

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done

Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a
Way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do
You wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
Used to show
In the moonlight
Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
Used to show
In the moonlight
Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness for you to come around

Oh these days oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades but you remain
Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you
I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it then I can atone

Oh these days oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades but you remain
Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Forgive me
Forgive me

Open up again I believe in second chances
Please let me in oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you I will not let you down
Open up again I believe in second chances

Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

Goodnight

Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks but not to me
'Cause heaven knows that nothing good comes free
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
Is there nothing good in me
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down

But I'll take your word
'Cause after all you've never lied
Oh not at all
But look at me
Oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down

To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
Thats nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper
Then I see its a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

There was a little old lady, who was walkin' down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah  that's city life

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Ooh

Friday night last orders at the pub,
Get in the car and drive to the club,
There's a massive crowd outside so we get in to the queue
It's quarter past 11 now we won't get in till quarter to.

It's quarter to and we get to the front,
Girl on a guest list dressed like a cunt
She asked security to check in my shoes,
You can play this game with me but you know you're gonna lose.

Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me cos you'll get reaction,
Another drink and I'm ready for action,
I don't know who you think you are,
But making people scared wont get you very far.

Ooh
Ooh

In the club make our way to the bar,
Good dancing love but you should of worn a bra.
Guy on the mike and he's making too much noise,
There's these girls in the corner wanting attention from the boys.

I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd,
Don't understand why they're being really loud.
They make their way over to me,
They try to push me out the way,
I'll push her back, she looks at me and says,
What you tryna say?

Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned


Ooh
Ooh

Oh, oh deary me
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
I don't understand how one could watch so much TV
Oh, my baby brother Alfie, how I wish that you could see.

I only say it cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Now, now, there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
My dear mon frere.

Oh Alfie, get up it's a brand new day
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
Get off your lazy ass, Alfie
Please use your brain
Surely there's some walls out there that you could go and spray
I'm feeling guiltier for leading you astray
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll ever get laid,
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

I only say it cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Now, now, there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
My dear mon frere.

Oh, little brother, please refrain from doing that
I'm trying to help you out, so can you stop being a twat
It's time that you and I sit down and have a little chat
And look me in the eyes take off that stupid fitted cap

I only say it cause I care,
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Now, now, there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
My dear mon frere.

A picture paints a thousand words,
As one door closes, another door opens,
And two wrongs don't make a right
Now good things come to those who wait,
Take the highs with the lows dear,
You'll get what your given and everything's gonna be alright.

What the fuck do you know?
Just cos you're old you think your wise,
But who the hell are you though,
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut,
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do you think I care?

[Chorus]
Say what you say,
Do what you do
Feel what you feel,
As long as it's real.
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real.

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself.
This horsey also told me,
I should keep my friends close but my enemies closer,
So as to protect myself.

What the fuck do you know?
Just cos you're old you think your wise,
But who the hell are you though,
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut,
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do u think care?

[Chorus]

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah





Alright so this is a song about anyone, it could be anyone.
You're just doing your own thing and some one comes out the blue,
They're like,
"Alright"
But he's saying,
"Yeah can I take your digits?"
And you're like, "No not in a million years, you're nasty
Please leave me alone."

Cut to the pub on a lads night out,
Man at the bar 'cause it was his shout,
Clocks this bird and she looks ok,
She caught him looking and she walks his way,
"Alright darlin, you gonna buy us a drink then?"
"Err no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend..."

She's got no taste hand on his waste, tries to pull away but her lips on his face,
"If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer"
"Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture."

You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think about the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"why?"
"'cause I've lost my phone".

"Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm, I'm pregnant, I'm having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah..."

I recognise this guys way of thinking,
As he walks over her face starts sinking,
She's like,
"oh here we go.."
It's a routine check that she already knows, she's thinking they're all the same.

"Yeah, you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?"
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag, tries to get away from the guy on a blag,
Can't find a light,
"Here, use mine"
"You see the thing is I just don't have the time."

You can't knock em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"'cause I've lost my phone".

Go away now, let me go,
Are you stupid? Or just a little slow?
"Please f*** off"
Go away now I've made myself clear,
I don't think so,
Nah it's not gonna happen,
Not in a million years,

You can't knock em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"'Cause I've lost my phone".

You can't knock em out, you can't walk away,
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
"Just get out my face" Just leave me alone",
"And no you can't have my number",
"'cause I've lost my phone".

"Aw, No, I gotta go, my house is on fire.",
"I've, I've got herpes, no syphalis. Aids aids, I've got aids.",
"Yeah, I forgot my Vagisil".

Do you think
Everything
Everyone
Is goin' mental
It seems to me
It's spiraling
Out of control
Well dont you think
This time is yours
This time is mine
Its temperamental

It seems to me
We're on all fours
Crawling on your knees someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ Almighty
Do i feel alright?
No not slightly
I wanna get a flat and no i can't afford it
Its just those bureacrats that wont give me a mortgage
Its very funny cause I got your fucking money
and I'm never gonna get it just of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose it's just the way the cookie crumbles

Oh yes I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

Well do you want
Something else
Something new
Than what we got here
Well do you feel
Its all the same
Some sick game
Its so insincere

I wish i could
Change the ways
Of the world
Make it a nice place
Until that day
I guess we stay
Doin' what we do, screwin' who we screw

Why can't i sleep at night
Gonna say its gonna be alright
I wanna be able to east spaghetti bolognese
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days

All the magazines they talk about weight loss
If i buy those jeans
I can look like Kate Moss
I know its not the life that i chose
But i guess thats just the way that things go

Now listen I think you and me have come to the end of our time,
What d'you want some kind of reaction?
Well OK that's fine,
Alright how would it make you feel if I said you that you never ever made me cum?
In the year and a half that we spent together,
Yeah I never really had much fun.

All those times that I said I was sober,
Well I'm afraid I lied,
I'd be lying next to you, you next to me,
All the time I was high as a kite.
I could see it in your face when you break it to me gentle,
Yeah you really must think your great,
Let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks,
When I work my way through your mates.

[Chorus]
I never wanted it to end up this way,
You've only got yourself to blame,
I'm gonna tell the world your rubbish in bed now
And that your small in the game.

I saw you thought this was gonna be easy,
Well your out of luck.
Yeah lets rewind, let's turn back time to when you couldn't get it up,
You know what it shoulda ended there,
That's when I shoulda shown you the door.
As is that weren't enough to deal with,
You became premature.

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental,
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me,
I'm gonna reciprocate.

[Chorus]

Your not big your not clever,
No you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever.

Your not big your not clever,
No you not a big brother
Not big what so ever.

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental,
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me,
I'm gonna reciprocate.

[Chorus]

Friday night last orders at the pub,
Get in the car and drive to the club,
There's a massive crowd outside so we get in to the queue
It's quarter past 11 now we won't get in till quarter to.

It's quarter to and we get to the front,
Girl on a guest list dressed like a cass
She asked security to check in my shoes,
You can play this game with me but you know you?re gonna lose.

[Bridge]
Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned,

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me cos you'll get reaction,
Another drink and I'm ready for action,
I don't know who you think you are,
But making people scared wont get you very far.

In the club make our way to the bar,
Good dancing love but you should of worn a bra.
Guy on the mike and he's making too much noise,
There's these girls in the corner wanting attention from the boys.

I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd,
Don't understand why they're being really loud.
They make their way over to me,
They try to push me out the way,
I'll push her back, she looks at me and says,
What you tryin' to say?

[Bridge]





I've been thinking that you've crossed the line,
If you disagree well that will be just fine,
Cause you waste my time and waste my money
And your not too cool and your not so funny!
Spreading your seed all over the town
Getting too greedy and messing around
Oh my gosh you must be joking me
If you think that you'll be poking me.

[Chorus]
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know,
Don't try to deny cause my fuse is ready to blow
Its your turn to learn I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame for you

Please don't come around and knock on my door
Cause I don't want to have to pick you up of the floor,
When you ask if we can still be lovers,
I'll have to introduce my brothers,
Think that they could teach you a lesson or two,
By the time they've finished you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby,
A sea of tears they'll call the navy in.





I don't want us to have a fight
But in the background
I can hear you chatting shit
I hear it every night
And you think you're being really cool
And you've been doing it
Since we were both at school
Now who looks like a fool

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've know it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

[Chorus]
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

What happened to the good old days?
I was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
Who are you anyway?
I know you've heard this all before
I know some people who are calling you a whore
Don't know you anymore

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've know it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

When you first left me
I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What'd you do that for? (what'd you do that for?)

When you first left me
I didn't know what to say
I'd never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack
No, it don't mean jack

I couldn't stop laughing
No, I just couldn't help myself
See, you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you cant have me number,
"why?"
Because I've lost my phone.

Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm pregnant,
having a baby in like 6 months so no, and yeah, yeah

"I recognise this guy..."
That's what she's thinking,
As he comes over her heart starts sinking,
She's like,
"oh here we go"
It's a routine check that she already knows,
she's thinking they're all the same.

"yeah you alright baby?
You look alright still, yeah what's your name?"
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag,
tries to get away from the guy on a blag, can't find a light,

Go away now, let me go,
Are you stupid? Or just a little slow?

Nah it's not gonna happen,
Not in a a million years,

Can't knock em out, can't walk away,

Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you cant have me number,

Try desperately to think of the politest way to say,
Just get out my face, just leave me alone,
And no you cant have me number,
"why?"
Because I've lost my phone.

Nah I've gotta go cos my house is on fire,
I've got herpes, err no I've got syphilis

Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper
Then I see its a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

There was a little old lady, who was walkin' down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah  that's city life

Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why?
Would I wanna be anywhere else

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

Do you think everything
Everyone is goin' mental?
It seems to me, it's spiraling
Out of control and it's inevitable

Well, don't you think
This time is yours
This time is mine?
It's temperamental

It seems to me
We're on all fours
Crawling on your knees
Someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel alright?
No, not slightly
I wanna get a flat

And no I can't afford it
It's just those bureaucrats
That won't give me a mortgage
It's very funny 'cause
I got your fucking money
And I'm never gonna get it
Just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well, I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose it's just the way
The cookie crumbles

Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

Well, do you want
Something else
Something newer
Than what we got here?
Well, do you feel

It's your turn to learn but I think that you know where to go
It's a shame shame shame for you

Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissin'
And I remember when you started callin' me your miss's
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too.

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if for only one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

Drinkin' tea in bed
Watching dvd's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
No one in the world who could replace you

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if for only one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

A picture paints a thousand words,
As one door closes, another one opens,
And two wrongs don't make a right
Now good things come to those who wait,
Take the highs with the lows dear,
You'll get what your given and everything's gonna be alright

What the fuck do you know?
Just cos you're old you think your wise,
But who the hell are you though,
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut,
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do you think I care?

Say what you say,
Do what you do
Feel what you feel,
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself
This horsey also told me,
I should keep my friends close but my enemies closer,

Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real

Ah

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

What happened to the good old days?
I was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
Who are you anyway?

I know you've heard this all before
I know some people who are calling you a whore
Don't know you anymore

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know
And some secrets weren't meant to be told
I found the cure to growing older

I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends

Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up

Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up

Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lip
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself

They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I left

Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up

Sat outside my front window
This story's going somewhere
He's well hung and I am hanging on
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started"
So let's get this party started

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imaginations much worse
I just never want to know
And what meant the world had folded
Like legs and fingers holding on to
A better kiss that never lasts

You said between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone
Dead and gone yeah

The calm before the storm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
A reception less than warm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight

This is me standing in the arch of the door
Hating that look that's on your face
That says there's another fool like me
There's one born every minute
There's one born every minute

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imaginations much worse
I just never want to know (never want to know)
What meant the world imploded
Inflated then demoted all my
Oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance

You said between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone
Dead and gone yeah

Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off)
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)

The calm before the storm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight

Sun burnt out tonight
The sun burnt out tonight

I dried my eyes, now I crust them with sleep
I'll crust them over
She begged me "don't hate me"
She spun me a story
Where winning looks like losing
And I win every time
So thread spools sweetie, get ready
Until my silk is sold

I've dried my eyes, now its "Rushmore"
I'm deep with futures like Chicago
Glenview never meant a thing to me
She never meant a thing to me
Except for putting idealists in a body bag
Forget it
I'll go out tonight to piss on her doorstep
And listen to the misfits "where eagles dare" to swallow whole

Up

Go

Whoa, oh,I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah,I guess I'm on my own
Yeah,I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I guess I'm on my own

I served out my detention
And in the end I got an honorable mention
In the movie of my life, starring you
Instead of me
When the moonlight, hits your bright eyes I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid
Like I'll never leave your side
Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
I burnt out
My defensive
Now everything I say is taken as offensive

Walking out on the show was walking out on you
And walking out on you was the best thing that I ever did.

Last night I saw my world explode.
Well, I'm looking out at you obscured by the stand up arcade
And the sound of the descendants.
Your smile reminds me of switchblades and infidelity.

Last night I saw my world explode.

Walking off that stage tonight
I know what you're thinking
"He stands alone because he's high on himself"
But if you only knew..

I was terrified and would you mind if I
sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend
and I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

The only girl who ever gave me the time
was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine
Knocking boots in the back,
How degrading is that?
I decline

I'm too terrified and would you mind if I
sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend
and I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no, no

This might just be a waste of time
there's no one I'd rather waste
My time with than all my best friends
So start the car up

We'll all take turns not for the worst
We're all "has-beens" and "never-were's"
And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne"
Just watching life pass us by
Pass us by

As if we cared
Enough to try to catch up
Enough to make up for lost time
Enough to make up for lost time, yeah

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

She's shallow like the shoreline during low tide
But my hopes are not quite as high
Can't spot her faults but she spotted mine
She left me for herself
Considering I would too
Go figure, I'm bigger than that
The battles only halfway done
I might look young
But I'm no less defeated
How's the weather up there?
Good God I wish I was tall

Last night I saw a movie
And I thought about many movies I've seen at your house
Excuse me if I'm rude
But I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without you
Leaning on my shoulder
Distracting me from the plot line

Where can I go when I want you around
But I' can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people
Looking glossed just like a summer ago

Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

"Call me back" I'm pleading with a cork in my head
It wouldn't be the first time
My pillow has been mistaken

Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

Can't stand to be around you
Around you, around you
Can't stand to be around you
Can't stand, I can't stand
To be around you
Around you

Laughed off my affections
While I passed by your direction
Should have known from your walk, yeah
It was the end of you

It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Quick with lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes it's times like this, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a big mouth
And maybe you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole foundation
Parker Lewis can't lose

Taking back every step towards you
Still failing at everything I do
In the meantime just talking with my shoes
Converse with my Converse
At least they hear a word I say
And scrutinize it
Just as far as they can tell what I'm getting at
Tied my tongue around my neck
For the last time

It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Quick with lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes, it's times like this yeah

[Chorus]

This is the last song about you
This is the last song that I waste on you

This might just be a waste of time
there's no one I'd rather waste
My time with than all my best friends
So start the car up

We'll all take turns not for the worst
We're all "hasbeens" and "never-were's"
And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne"
Just watching life pass us by
Pass us by

As if we cared
Enough to try to catch up
Enough to make up for lost time
Enough to make up for lost time, yeah

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night
Waste this night

We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging 'round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town
Waste this night

Light that smoke for giving up on me
And one just cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations
"I could have died with you"
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle I confess
Now ash yourself out on the insides, when I said I loved you I swear I lied

Let's play this game called "when you catch fire"
I wouldn't piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
Wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home
Joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks great next to his teeth

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
But we never stood a chance
And I'm not sure if it matters

If you are the shores
I am the waves begging for big moons
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no

Your secret's out

I know this hurts, it was meant to
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over, you don't, don't matter

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
But it must be said again
That all us boys are just screaming

Into microphones for attention
Because we're just so bored
We never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts

Your secret's out

I know this hurts, it was meant to
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over, you don't, don't matter

I used to obsess over living
Now I only obsess over you
Tell me you'd like boys like me better
In the dark lying in on top of you

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters

This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times
That I'm not sure if it matters

I know this hurts, it was meant to
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over, you don't, don't, don't, don't matter

From day one I talked about getting out
But not forgetting about how all my worst fears are letting out
He said, "Why put a new address on the same old loneliness?"
When breathing just passes the time
Until we all just get old and die

Now talking's just a waste of breath
And living's just a waste of death
And why put a new address on the same old loneliness?
And this is you and me and me and you
Until we've got nothing left

Landing on a runway in Chicago and I'm grounding all my dreams of ever really seeing California, because I know what's in between is something sensual in such non-conventional ways.

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say.
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away.
Tonight is all about "We miss you."

And I can't forget your style or your cynicism,
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen to everything we said.
My smile's an open wound without you...and my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back.

These friends are, new friends are golden.

You only hold me up like this
'Cause you don't know who I really am
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you
We're making out inside crashed cars
We're sleeping through all our memories
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive (now I only waste my time dreaming of you)

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
All of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same

I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you
I'm not trying
You only hold me up like this

My heart is on my sleeve
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness
That means I believed
Every single lie you said

Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little tap on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck
Out in front of your neighbor's house

She took me down and said
"Boys like you are overrated. So save your breath"
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads.

You want apologies, girl you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever
The only thing you'll get
Is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever

With every breath I wish your body
Will be broken again

Bury me standing under your window with the cinder block in hand
Yeah cause no one will ever feel like this again
And if I could move I'm sure it would only be to crawl back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block...they were gone by the time we (talked)

I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details I don't want to know a thing

I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun. Remind me which side you should be on.

I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel.

My heart ticks in beat with
These kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know
Where we came from and where we call home

Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, we love you back

They'll say it's not worth
So we'll leave this town in ruins
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know
These busted lips we take back home

Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these time will never fade

How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well, I'd hope that since we're here anyway
We could end up saying
Things we always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)

How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)

I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
I know you're wondering when

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like deja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight

Singing Amen, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
And I'm singing

Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive
Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing Amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

This time, this place misused, mistakes
Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted, I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed, I need to hear you say
That I love you, I've loved you all along
And I forgive you, for being away for far too long
So keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and
Never let me go, keep breathing
Keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and
Never let me go, keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

Ouh, and now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test

I like the white stains on your dress
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)

And I love your lack of self respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

Ouh and I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

Ouh and now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it
Ooh

Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you, come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings
I'm fallin' and all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And, oh, I scream for you come, please
I'm callin' and all I need from you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Hurry, I'm fallin'

And all I need is you
Come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin'
I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Hurry, I'm fallin'

Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

I'm through with standin' in lines to clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub
Big enough for ten plus me
(Yeah, so what you need?)

I need a a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher
And James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves
To blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writin' all my songs
Lipsync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

Well it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything that we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooooohhhhhhh

We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, the tequila just hit me
Ooooohhhhh
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown

We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
To get anything that we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooooohhhhhhh

Ticking like a time bomb, drinking till the nights gone
Well get you hands out of this glass, last call my ass
Weeelllll no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
To get anything that we want
To drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooooohhhhhhh
We're going out tonight
To kick out every light
To get anything that we want
To drink everything in sight
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without
A sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet

Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and
I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with him must have
Damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet

Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet

Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet, no, no

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time I had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must of done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of lookin' out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They said somebody went and burnt it down

We use to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I

[Chorus]

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me

Wake up, my baby still look amazing with no make-up
Damn it I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers say, I wanna meet your mother
Your daddy, your sister and your brother

One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
But darling my shit moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Said it's only twenty karats it can't be that hard to find it baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

Light on Sunset, can't imagine the two ain't having fun yet
Baby maybe just wait 'cause I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I looked over man
Way to sugar coated you were busy motorboatin'
On that blonde girl
Keep up with what you're doing
Ain't nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another come along girl
If you ain't afraid to try it
You know we'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you wanna you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

She's got me runnin' round and round

Flo Rida girl, you got me runnin' round hey
What a perfect misses, my misses still eat McDonalds
Taste delicious prim madonna knock this swiss so I guess she did it
What my kisses, what my pictures
Steppin' the oo back pay a visit
To my baby yeah my baby girl
Run around town on a treadmill
I ain't going nowhere, no underwear
That's what she wear
Gotta playmate wanna join the party
She was supposed to be like Hugh Hef
Birthday cake wanna grant my wishes
Every day I'm losing my breath
Can't replace that face, that waist
I chase this girl, a barefoot dare, baby

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you wanna you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

I miss you
So, so, I do
I miss you
So, so, I do
I miss you
So

I just woke up from a dream today
Time gone by but you still look the same
Felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you
That I

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
(I miss you, so, so, I do) so, so, I do
I miss you
So, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do

After dark, laughin' in the rain
Silver heart locket on a chain
Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do

If there was some way, you know I would
I'd do it today, I wish I could
I call out your name, it does no good
I wish I knew what would

I, I miss you so much
God knows I do, I
I wish my wish was enough
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so

Where will you be when the sky comes down?
And what would you do if the strength was found?
Stand right beside me when the ground starts shaking
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Once it's started, there's no turning back
And I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
When you're standing in the heart of darkness
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Holding on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home

Holding on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Holding on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light come on

Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We find the light come on

This is the calm before the coming storm
If we can find the light
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We find the light come on

I know it's late but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warning
And I'm tired of ignoring all the space that's between you and I
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite.

Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite.

Do you recall how long it must have been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means.
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite.

Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite.

Dance around the moon,
You and I every night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

I cant believe that days took into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay
Inside this atmosphere

Dance around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

Dance with me around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite

Before this hits the ground,
Before this fades away,
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around,
Before I walk away,
I want you to make me
Make me
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again
Believe again

If you could take the dirt
And wash it all away
If you could say the words
That make me want to stay
Just tell me there's a chance
To Hell with all the blame.
If you could take my hand,
If you could lead the way,
I want you to make me,
Make me,
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

She's got me nervous
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour
She's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, what's wrong with right here on the counter?

Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola roller-coaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.

So good I never wanna waste it
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybody's faces

Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola roller-coaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.

What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)
What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

Slow it down, make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
Cause its to much, yeah its a lot
To be something I'm not

I'm a fool, out of love
'Cause I just can't get enough

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down
I know, I've got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

The sun is hot in the sky
Just like a giant spot light
The people follow the signs
And synchronize in time

It's a joke, no body knows
They've got a ticket to that show
Yeah

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down
I know, I've got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

Just enjoy the show

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone
I've tried, and I don't know why

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down
I know, I've got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

Just enjoy the show
Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back

Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back

Just enjoy the show

I won't let this burden bring me down.

So here we are again
Starin' at the end
Of what we made and who we are.
Never knowin' when
One of us will break apart
And walk the other way, love.
I don't know what to say, love.
I don't know how to stay
When you won't let me be
The person that I am.

The writings on the wall.
There?s nothin' to say anymore.
So ill leave before I fall apart
Right back into your arms.
The writings on the wall.
You gave nothin' back at all.
But I want something better.
I won't let this burden bring me down.

What are we to do?
What are we to say to one another
Now were through?
Thanks for bein' you.
Thanks for bein' all things
I had to say goodbye to.
I'm over bein' lied to.
I'm over bein' pushed into the person
That you want me to become.

The writings on the wall.
There?s nothin' to say anymore.
So ill leave before I fall apart
Right back into your arms.
The writings on the wall.
You gave nothin' back at all.
But I want something better.
I won't let this burden bring me down.

Oh where did it go wrong?
We had it for so long.
But now there's no point in turning back
Let's face the fact

The writings on the wall.
There?s nothin' to say anymore.
So ill leave before I fall apart
Right back into your arms.
The writings on the wall.
You gave nothin' back at all.
But I want something better.
I won't let this burden bring me down.

I won't let this burden bring me down.

Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to

But if I should break, if I should fall away
What am I to do?
I need someone to take, a little of the weight
Or ill fall through

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

Take a little time, walk a little line
Got the balance right
Give a little love, gimme just enough
So that I can hang on tight

We will be alright, I'll be by your side
I wont let you down
But I gotta know, no matter how things go
That you will be around

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

Don't let me fall

Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

You'll be the one that I'll love forever more
I'll be here holding you high above it all
But don't let me fall

I will never be, I will never be tall, no
And I will never be, never ever be sure of it all
Oh, why is the world so cruel to me
When all, all I ever want to be is anything I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

I will never be, I will never be you, no
I will always be, I will always be me, that I know
But oh, even though I'm happy being me
I want to get away from all this harsh reality, oh

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

Anything I'm not
Oh, anything I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
I'm not

A second, a minute, and hour, a day goes by.
I'm hopin' just to be by your side.
I'm turnin' the handle
It won't open.
Don't make me wait, cause right now I need your smile.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

Knockin'

A warm bath, a good laugh, an old song that you know by heart.
I've tried it but they all leave me cold.
So now I'm here waiting to see you,
My remedy for all that's been hurting me.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

You seem to know the way
To turn my frown upside down
You always know what to say
To make me feel like everything?s ok.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

Knockin'
Nothin' works like you, oh oh
Knockin'

Knock Knock
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door.
You're all I need right now its true.
Nothin' works like you.

It's difficult to see from the surface.
But everything goes in and it stings,
Like a spider.
Hits you deep inside and

I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
Well I ordinarily breathe.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.

All these words that we speak casually.
Well maybe I'm just weak, but it hurts me.
Well it cuts, like a knife
It hurts me deep inside and

I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
Well I ordinarily breathe.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.

I should put on my armor the next time I see you
So I won't be harmed. I know I can shoot my own arrows.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I know that like me you can be oversensitive.

I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
Well I ordinarily breathe.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.

Yeah it's dangerous and sweet.
Don't you know it's dangerous and it's sweet?
Cut us and we bleed.

Trouble will find you no mater where you go, oh oh
No Matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow, oh oh
The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn, oh oh
Your fine for a while but then start to loose control

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. oh oh

Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe, oh oh
And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow, oh oh
He sees what I see and he knows what I know, oh oh
So don't forget as you ease on down the road


So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win, but I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh

Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave, I try
Oh Oh I try

One of these days you'll be
Under the covers you'll be
Under the table and you'll realize
All of your days are numbered
All of them one to one hundred
All of them millions
All of them trillions
So what are you gonna do with them all?
You can not trade them in for mall
No no

Take every moment, you know that you own them
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you

Give me a reason
To fight the feeling
That there's nothing here for me
Cause none of its easy
I know it wasn't meant to be
I know it's all up to me, I know it's all up to me
So what am I gonna do with my time?

I'll take every moment, I know that I own them
It's all up to you to do whatever you choose

Live like you're dying and never stop trying
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you

All of the moments you didn't notice
Gone in the blink of an eye
All of the feelings you couldn't feel
No matter how you try

So tired of feeling blue.
Such a heavy weight on you.
So shake it off and make your way
Oh no now you're leaving me
Oh what will you do all alone
In the big bad world?
I'm not worried, no.

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna skip along,
Quite merrily, baby.
You're gonna ravel in hate.
And what's goin' on?
And you're like a sugar ball
And oh how you could
No I will come and you'll
Just skip along.

Were so oblivious.
Comes natural to us.
Keep smiling knowing all the while

[Chorus]

Wouldn't it be lovely to be home? oh
Safe and sound and no one left
To bring us down but so far away.


No I will come if we just skip along.

[Chorus]
I can't forget you when you're gone
Your like a song
That goes around in my head
And how I regret
It's been so long
Oh what went wrong
Could it be something I said
Time, make it go faster
Or just rewind
To back when I'm wrapped in your arms

All afternoon long
It's with me
The same song
You left a light on
Inside me
My love

I can remember
The way that it felt
To be holding on to you

[Chorus]

Time
Make it go faster
Or just decide
To come back to my happy heart.

You and me will be lying side by side
Forever forever
Underneath this adolescent sky
Together together
And you will hold my heart inside your hand
And You'll be the one, the one to tell me

[Chorus]
Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
To get there
We'll get there
But oh, if there's one thing that we know
It's that we will not grow old

You made me swear that our hearts will never die
No never, no never
Cause no one seems to believe that we can fly
Forget them, forget them
Oh, you told me

[Chorus]

Oh, how could we know that day, it came with age
That oh, the feeling would fade

[Chorus]

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

Woke my weary head
Crawled out of my bed
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"
Nothing's going right, shadow's took the light
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving love to find a way
Through this messy life I made for myself
Heaven knows I need a little

Hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

I gave my hope to you
When you were early through
And you said, "Oh, I can't go on
Well, now I need it back
'Cause I have got a lack of all that's good
And I can't go on

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Everything's okay, everything's okay
Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Roll, roll with the punches
Roll, roll with the punches

That really hurt me
Like a fist to the face
I wasn't ready
To be knocked out of place
Suddenly everything I was sure of
Sinking below the depths of the surface
It's unexpected, it usually is
When you're rejected
Or you take a hit
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

Little weapons over the phone
They like to threaten the life that I know
They say get over here and get into the ring
But I'm not really much a fighter
My mechanisms of defense are down
My resistance is out on the town
I was alarmed by your attack
This isn't a boxing match
But I'll be damned if I ever let you win

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

When all I want is a little stability
Some time without any bruises
You go and tell me the things that I don't want to hear
Putting your fist into my ears
Filling me up with the dread and the fear leaving you all in pieces
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to hold, hold, hold your head up high
When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

Woke my weary head
Crawled out of my bed
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"
Nothing's going right, shadow's took the light
And I said, "Oh, how do I go on?"

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Keep giving me hope for a better day
Keep giving love to find a way
Through this messy life I made for myself
Heaven knows I need a little

Hope for a better day
Keep giving me love to find a way
Through this heaviness I feel
I just need someone to say, everything's okay

I gave my hope to you
When you were early through
And you said, "Oh, I can't go on
Well, now I need it back
'Cause I have got a lack of all that's good
And I can't go on

Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Everything's okay, everything's okay
Sometimes I need a little sunshine
And sometimes I need you

Just when you think that it will never get you
It comes and throws a lightning bolt right at you
Before you know it now your pulse starts racing
And now your blood is running hot like crazy

Oh, give it everything, everything that you've got

No, I never knew that I could feel this way
No, I never had it running through my veins
No, I never thought that it could be enough
Suddenly you, you shock me into love

It's waiting for you right around the corner
It doesn't have the decency to warn ya
It comes along and taps you on the shoulder
You fall the arms that now will hold ha

Oh, give it everything, everything that you've got

No, I never knew that I could feel this way
No, I never had it running through my veins
No, I never thought that it could be enough
Suddenly you, you shock me into love

Electricity shoots from you to me

As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox
As fast as a hare, as brave as a bear
As free as a bird, as neat as a word
As quiet as a mouse, as big as a house

All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
All I wanna be is everything

As mean as a wolf, as sharp as a tooth
As deep as a bite, as dark as the night
As sweet as a song, as right as a wrong
As long as a road, as ugly as a toad

As pretty as a picture hanging from a fixture
Strong like a family, strong as I wanna be
Bright as day, as light as play
As hard as nails, as grand as a whale

All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
All I wanna be is everything

As warm as the, the sun, as silly as fun
As cool as a tree, as scary as the sea
As hot as fire, cold as ice
Sweet as sugar and everything nice

As old as time, as straight as a line
As royal as a queen, as buzzed as a bee
Stealth as a tiger, smooth as a glider
Pure as a melody, pure as I wanna be

All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
All I wanna be is everything at once

She moved in to the house next door
Said she'd never been in love before
Tried the best she could to hide herself away

But every time she turned the lights down low
He thought he heard a voice calling out so slow
Come and take me away from all this pain
And he said

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart

You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Every morning when she came outside
He tried to be the one to catch her eye
But she would only turn away and hide

He started to concoct a plan
To get her to return the feelings that he had
To show her how he thought they were entwined

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart

You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Little love letters written in red
Folded up, put away next to the bed, oh
Little crushed hopes every day
Waiting in the wings to spirit her away

I don't know anymore
I don't know what I've been fighting for
But something inside me won't go quietly

And I could be anywhere
'Cause we're all breathing the same air
It goes inside and makes me feels alive
And all I can say is, all I can say

I am here and I will be
Following my own way
Forever and a day
I am here and I'm here to stay

Oh, we are here and we will be
Following our own way
No matter what you say
We are here and we're here to stay
We are here to stay

No matter where you roam
Anywhere you lay your heart's your home
Stand your ground if they push you down
Because all you can say is, all you can say

We are here and we will be
Following our own way
No matter what you say
We are here and we're here to stay

We are real and we feel it
When you deny us
Or when you get tired of us
We are here and we're here to stay
We are here to stay

I never knew when enough was enough
Or whether to stay when the going was tough
But I won't let a little heart be afraid
And all I can say is, all I can say

I am here and I will be
Following my own way
Forever and a day
I am here and I'm here to stay

Oh, we are here and we will be
Following our own way
No matter what you say
We are here and we're here to stay
We are here to stay

Little crushed hopes every day
Waiting in the wings to spirit her away

Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real; don't give me fake
Give me strength; reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time; give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one, 'cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength; reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me all your politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

But give me love over, love over, love over this, ahhh
And give me love over, love over, love over this, ahhh

Where do we go nobody knows?
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've gotta say...
I wasted all your time, honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face
Yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down... when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
Ah yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down...when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face

Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, oh, sing one we know
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say oh
I say oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, yeah, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are, you are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
It...

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realized
Who cannot live without
Ooh and come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

That green eyes
Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Since I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes
Green eyes
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Honey you are the rock
Upon which I stand

A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
I miss you so
And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

Oooooooo

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms

A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Who remembers your face
Who remembers you when you are gone

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me
Look for me when I am lost
And just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper

(Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper)
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Who remembers your face
Who remembers you when you are gone

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me
Look for me when I am lost
And I am just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Oh ha ah ah ah ah ah ah

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and I missed em
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Woahhh ohhh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that

You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Woahh ohhh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces
A tide of the human race
So, an answer now is what I need...

I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon
Oh come on love stay with me...

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
Is on your side, It's on your side now
Not pushing you down, and all around
No it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose

You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose

Stuck in a corner
are monkeys in cages
that don't have a number
to fight one another

Try to recover

Climb up the ladder
look up and you see birds
blind as each other
how long can we suffer?

We're as blind as each other

On the cloud that you're sitting
there's one born every minute
so much to discover
I've become a believer

Sisters and brothers
who fight one another
will mourn and deceive us
will find us and keep us

Take us or leave us

How soon is now? yeah
how long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
with something together

Come on and stick together

On the cloud that you're sitting
there's one born every minute
so much to discover
I've become a believer

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Get's colder day by day, I miss her

I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Get's colder day by day, I miss you

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown

Oh all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
Cause here
Everybody here's got somebody to lean on

I awake to find no peace of mind
I said how do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear
I said, what do I know
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
But the spies hide out in every corner
You can't touch them no, 'cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, which way do I turn
Oh I forget everything I learn

But the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
The spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

And if we all hide here
They're going to find us
If we don't hide now
They're going to catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're going to find us

And spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
Though spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you no
'Cause they're just spies
They're just spies

Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, oh, sing one we know
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say oh
I say oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, yeah, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh

Oh no I see
A spider web it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I said
Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I've done

And oh I never meant to cause you trouble
And oh and I never meant to do you wrong
And oh well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

Singing out
Oh I never meant to cause you trouble
Oh I never meant to do you wrong
Oh well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
X4

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure

Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

When I'm counting up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulder
I drove the other ones away

If you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
Everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

Cause if you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost

But you pay me no attention, do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you

And on and on from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you can

Did she want me to change
Well I change for good
And I want you to know
But you always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver, shiver, shiver

I'll always be waiting for you
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you

And is this is my final chance of getting you

And on and on from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep

Just you try and stop me

Just to see if you care

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Did she want me to change

And I'll always be waiting for you

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh and it's the part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I'll lose myself tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight

I woke up with the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I'll lose myself tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight (Whoo)
Lose myself tonight

So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I go to civil rights rallies
And i put down the old d.a.r.
I love harry and sidney and sammy
I hope every colored boy becomes a star
But don't talk about revolution
That's going a little bit too far
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I cheered when humphrey was chosen
My faith in the system restored
I'm glad the commies were thrown out
Of the a.f.l. c.i.o. board
I love puerto ricans and negros
As long as they don't move next door
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

The people of old mississippi
Should all hang their heads in shame
I can't understand how their minds work
What's the matter don't they watch les crain?

I hope the cops take down your name
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I read new republic and nation
I've learned to take every view
You know, i've memorized lerner and golden
I feel like i'm almost a jew
But when it comes to times like korea
There's no one more red, white and blue
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

I vote for the democtratic party
They want the u.n. to be strong
I go to all the pete seeger concerts
He sure gets me singing those songs
I'll send all the money you ask for
But don't ask me to come on along
So love me, love me, love me, i'm a liberal

Once i was young and impulsive
I wore every conceivable pin
Even went to the socialist meetings
Learned all the old union hymns

I am just an innocent Bastard
What can you expect from me?
My energy is empty
My batteries run low
Life leads into a hopeless situation
Leaves me with a broken motivation
I can't try harder
No one who fights more than me

I don't want to try no more
I don't really want to cry no more
This time I quit
No place for me to fit
I don't want to give no more
I don't really want to live no more
This world is sick
Welcome to the Silent Republic

I know we share this feeling
I know the pain you hide
You're sick of your senseless being
Attracted to suicide
Agonized by the fools who don't care
We will break from the truth of despair
No one tries harder
No one who fights more than us

We don't want to try no more
We don't really want to cry no more
This time we quit
No place for us to fit
We don't want to give no more
We don't really want to live no more
You think we're sick?
We are the silent Republic

Fly nigga couldn't tell me nothing different homes
And I be good til the fat woman sing a note
I'm tryna find life's meaning up in this Patron
I'm taking women to heaven and then I take em home
I'm waking up with something twenty something fly shit
Wanna stunt shit, all that new designer shit
Word, she said she love me but she lying
Shit I'm lying too! Told that bitch I love her for her mind
Well that's quite true, bust-a-move, head game lover boo
Bust that pussy open, turn that sofa to a fuckin pool
I'm playing Cody, smoking stogies, make the rhythm better
I'm looking good in everything, but she look good in leather
Call me cocky I love it, baby father a sucker
I'm longer than em I ain't talking no Rockin Republic
I don't shop in the public, ain't finna wait in line
This not a free throw, this easy as a lay-up line

If I got time, you got time too
You with a boss, baby, so when I move you move
Let's have some drinks, Malibu and how I do
And after that we do whatever we want to
Girl I'm in charge, that means I'm coolin
I'm on my own agenda, that means I'm coolin
Baby I'm large, that means I'm coolin
Dealin with a winner, that mean I'm coolin

Pimp-stroll on em, the pen cold on em
Couldn't fuck with it with a million nymphos on ya
Bitches tend to love a nigga with the most money
I tell em "honey, I know Cher, I'm so sunny"
And this is all pro-bono
All-Star weekend floor seats by the coaches
Flying all frequent, reclining on beaches
Half a millie on the road, y'all relyin on features
I ain't married, but I'm tryna find a keeper
If she cook and keep her vagina like a secret
And we fuck, I beast up and throw a little peace up
So peace out, I'mma get up with you in like three months
Word, absence will make the heart grow
With that said, I ain't around like my old combs
And I be drinking all the brown straight, no Coke
I'm chasing money, not the liquor, y'all ain't even close
So let's have a toast, everything fine
This ain't a free throw, this easy as a lay-up line

If I got time, you got time too
You with a boss, baby, so when I move you move
Let's have some drinks, Malibu and how I do
And after that we do whatever we want to
Girl I'm in charge, that means I'm coolin
I'm on my own agenda, that means I'm coolin
Baby I'm large, that means I'm coolin
Dealin with a winner, that mean I'm coolin

[Intro - J-Kwon - talking]
Ay world, this Streets 101
I'm fin' to give you a half a pound of J-Kwon
And a quarter bird of TrackBoy music

[Hook - J-Kwon]
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse - J-Kwon]
This the new improved Hood Hop
I make erry mu'fucker in this bitch do the whop
Derty run his mouth 'til the album drop (why's that?)
TrackBoy beat like a freak, work a king on the block
I'm seventeen, name ain't same on the block
And beat and knock the nigga out his frame on the block
And he'll come through and let rang on the block
And all they got to say is it's a shame on the block
I'm hot HOMEBOY! don't ever get it twisted
Number's unlisted, stayed in 3rd district
For real, I'm ready to get naughty
Best of both worlds so, hey shawty!
Show me the party, and I'll show you the coke
I can show you my dick, you can show me your throat
If a nigga trip-trip then we'll show him the fo'
If his niggaz run up to you, we'll show him so mo'

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Now I wish a nigga would run up like that
When I put that on the hood, I'ma strike back
And niggaz talk shit, but I don't like that
Sayin' I don't like G, but I ain't write that
And baby mamas mad they ain't 'bout shit
Basically what I'm sayin dude, fuck a bitch
And if I had two, I'd touch a bitch
In the same breath turn around and touch her clit
And nigga if I said then I fuckin' meant it
And nigga if it's rented I ain't fuckin' in it
TrackBoyz give me money so I fuckin' spend it
y'all roll Sprewells but not the authentics
And fuck ya-fuck ya fo' and ya roof clown
I got shit that'll turn ya fuckin' Coupe 'round (*gun cocking*)
You ain't heard? I'm the truth now
Matter fact, hook gon' break it down
Break it down

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Dogg it's a mystery..
How we drop one single, left the game now the whole world miss me
Freak this bitch like homegirl Missy
Like I'm sellin' liqour, got the whole world "Tipsy"
Sick and tired of old g's tryin' to gip me
So I put a lump in his shit, like a hickey
All I say is to them, "Dude come get me"
Watch 'em catch a crude desire, like a gypsy
Funny how I can't loc in public
Smoke in public, girl even joke in public
Got dough, so that's why I'm so republic
Cops hit the do', I start actin' so republic
I had a set, they actin' like I had a brick or more
So you got snitched on by the carni-whore
Show-Off or show ass what these guns are for
Or let the priest show her mom what these nuns are for

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'ma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[21 second instrumental to open]

[Z-Ro]
If somebody got a problem with me, come and address it
If the shoe fits it then walk in it I'm talkin to Texas
See I'm from a section where we kid each other for practice
So I keep grenades and a chopper right under my mattress
Please don't let the gold and the diamonds fool you
I promise it's nothin for your family to lose you
It's just when you speak to me watch ya tone, call the chief on the phone
Bring the beef to your home, make you sleep under some stones
Z-Ro the Crooked, but you faggots already know my name mayne
Know you'd love to catch me slippin in the turnin lane mayne
Fuck a rap tuck my strap right in back of my britches
I'm just rappin to pay my lawyer for creatin a witness
I done smoked somebody befo' and smokin's a bad habit
They say it always take you to your casket, but fuck death
Cause I ain't scared, bitch I'm ready to fly
But until I go I'ma murk niggaz and get my fetti right now

I'm a soldier, these stankers keep me reachin for my holster
Sometime I feel my death is creepin closer
But I'ma keep on thuggin like I'm 'posed ta, 'posed ta

[Z-Ro]
Look at the conditions I was livin in, I didn't have a clear vision then
I needed ends cause there was no residence for me to sleep in
Nigga the streets raised me, man they played me sometime
But a real nigga regroup relax and take this back on his grind
I was gifted with a sick grip game, and it stick to the spoon
Plus I'm gifted at spittin make my vocals click to a tune
Bitch I'm schizophrenic, I probably won't stick to this mood
Hope I don't lose it 'fore I have to bring this brick to this dude
I heard some niggaz got somethin to say 'bout me back in the hood
Can't be Mo City, cause everyday I'll be back in the hood
And we can scrap or we can take it to the straps in the hood
You get your stuff or be murdered and won't be back in the hood
Same way I stack the republic I'm just like that in the hood
Bring to you a hat in public or a hat in the hood
Niggaz say Rap-A-Lot ain't payin me like I ain't got nuttin
If six figures is bein bent over, I'm lovin the fuckin

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
All you niggaz that talk down, just might get walked down
Become another statistic and down these war grounds
Nigga pull up your hands, just look at each other
But guaranteed to beat up a bitch he gon' wanna make me suffer
So I shoot first, look at his head burst, bleedin
And exit to dig a ditch that's even, give me the reason
Promise I've been lookin to get some stress off
I let the muh'fuckin mac-11 hack everything under the neck off
Used to be a problem child now I'm a problem grown up
I done done some evil shit and one day I'ma have to own up
But when I say somethin homey I mean what I say
I'ma murder you straight up or I can lean when I spray
Z-Ro the "fuck everybody" nigga from Screwed Up Click
Now I ain't gon' let you bend over to tie your shoes up bitch
I'ma launch a Bernard Hopkins type of blow in your jaw
That's the way I police my perimeter, Ro is the law

[Chorus]

The requested track is not viewable.

I'm older but you're wiser than anyone can see
Your patient like no other has even been with me
Your eyes take me to places
I'd never dreamt about
Your voice is the only music I can't do without

There can't be any doubts now
We're just too far ahead to look behind
And above the good and bad

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

Your hands that have no mercy
Are also my best friends
And I can get lost climbing on your legs that never end
I found a perfect distance between my body on you
And that is no distance, dear if that's alright with you
They said we wouldn't make it
But look at how we've beating all the odds
I just need you to be aware of that

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

I just want you to take a leap of faith
No it's easy to make all the same mistakes
But I won't this time, no, not this time

I need you to believe in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

A dozen icy summers were leading me to you
I had to hear the liars to recognize the truth
Remember the first Christmas
It almost seemed untrue
You promised that you'd always be with me
And I promised too

Boy meets a girl
Hid behind a wall
Piling up the bricks
Hoping they would fall

Girl meets a boy
Surrenders to his charms
Leaves her old boyfriend and crumbles in his arms

And if they wanna make me pay now
Then go on
Cause loving you was never wrong

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

Lazy for a while
Laying golden eggs
Some just want your money or whatever they can take

But hearing your name
Don't need anyone else
You're here because you want me
And not for what I make

Hey, they better know
If there is a price to pay now, the game is on
Cause in the end you know I won

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

And every camera flash my way
And every word of every page
Well they can say whatever they want to
Cause what we got is just so real
That they can't feel the way I feel
Cause I would do it all again for you

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
'Cause it's so bright (so bright)
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind

Every morning when I woke up
I was choked up
I was leaving without a purpose
Always jumping all the hurdles
Doing circles in the dark with a broken compass

I can't explain the way it feels
I could trip on my own words
I make mistakes, that's much is clear
But I made it here my love
Yeah I made it here my love

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if mess up everything someday
I would hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

One thing I got right
One thing I got right

Every morning when you wake up
I wanna hold you
I just need to be wrapped around you
It's kinda funny when you think that you just got here
Now I know I can't live without you

I can't explain the way it feels
I could choke my own words
Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
Like you're really here my love, yeah, you're really here my love

You're the one thing that I got right
It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if mess up everything someday
I would hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

Every time I see your smile
Every time I hear your laugh
Baby you bring in new sunshine over now
You are the little dream
Ever since I was a child
My fairytale comes true when I look at your face
May not be here forever
But it'll be a long road together
I already know
We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

You're the one thing that I got right
And if mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
You're the one thing that I got right

One thing I got right
One thing I got right

La la la la la

I dare you!

All of my life, to late
To you showed out with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you

Of all the millions, on the planet
You're the one is keeping me on it
You know I like you, and nobody's business
And your are my witness
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
I dare you to touch me
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
I dare you

I found your t-shirt
And I stripped your bed
I left you perfect
But there's no appreciation

I listened sweetly to your sour tone
I loved you only
But there's no reciprocation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left
In my heart, in my soul

Should have never helped
You become so powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
But you just don't care about me

You say you're thirsty
So I pour the wine
The bottle's empty
But there's no consummation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left
In my heart, in my soul

Should have never helped
You become so powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
But you just don't care about me

Oh, baby, how we used to dance
I couldn't separate from your hands
Now they don't even play that song anymore
You don't care about me

No, don't care about me
No, don't care about me
You don't care about me, no
Don't care about about me, no

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
But you just don't care about me

Take off all of your skin
And brave when you are free
Shake off all of your sins
And give them to me
Close up, let me back yea
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
Wooo wooo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo

I will follow you down wherever you go
I, I'm, baby, I'm bound to you and do you know?
Closer, pull me in tight
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
Woo woo
We are alive
Woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
We are alive
Woo

I'm just gonna raise my head
Welcome to the final edge
And I'm gonna fall
I'm just gonna raise my head
And hold you close

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
Woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo woo
And I'm like woo

And I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat
Yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do
When it comes to you
I see only the good
Selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah
You gotta hold on me, I never met someone so different

Oh here we go
You're a part of me now
You're a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

I can't remember to forget you

I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say
Is not to forget
You see only the good
Selective memory

The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
Do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
Do anything for that boy

I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
Do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
Do anything for that boy

Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you

And I feel again losing my mind
Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Keeps me and my arguments come under
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I always throw the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
No you won't see me popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

You're my medicine

Why do you say things
If you do not mean them
Why do you fill up my wounds
With your dirt

Bullets of fire
This time I can't shield them
Santa Maria, I know how it hurts

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

Why do you make me believe we are spirits
Mourning together to conquer this Earth (Mourning together)
Climb up the mountains
So high we can see them
Then send me to plummet with savaging words

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

I am covered in scars
Like a rose without thorns
My defenses are gone
No one's out there to warn
If there's love in your heart
Let me leave now in peace
You know you took it too far

'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so, so, so
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so

The requested track is not viewable.

The requested track is not viewable.

You can be my alphabet
And I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator

I will time you as you run up to down
And you will measure my footsteps as I pleasure this town
The mean of our heights is divided by the
Nights
Which is timed by the daggers in the root of all our fights

The pass of your poem is to sway me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

I am a dash and you are a dot, when will you see that I am all that you've got?

I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago, but to you I'm just a novel that you wish you never wrote

I'm greater than x, and lesser than y

So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?

You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I'm sitting here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one
And if I'm four words then I am needing of your love.

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia
Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia

When I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I look around me
And feel you are ever so close to me
Each tear that flows from my eye
Brings back memories of you to me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You were all, you alone and no one else
You were meant for me

When morning comes again
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by
Until finally my time descends on me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

Come along it is the break of day
Surely now, you'll have some things to say
It's not the time for telling tales on me

So come along, it wont be long
'Til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies
In this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

Well it's been rough but we'll be just fine
Work it out yeah we'll survive
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate

So come along, it wont be long
'Til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies
In this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of work
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight I'm tired can't we just sleep tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

I'm being dragged down, down by the hand
The hand of a golden giant man
He's crushing my knuckles
Splitting my skin, he says he will
If only I'd ask it of him

He says
Girl, it's your call
You wanna fly
You wanna fall
So I shout
I wanna get away from you
As fast as I can
I tell my feet to move it
I hope they have a plan

[Chorus]
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today

So now I'm free
Free
From the big bad giant

Who was stalking me
Thank you feet, for guiding me
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least

[Chorus]

Sometimes I'm tempted
Sometimes I am
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man
He was the line between pleasure and pain
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim

[Chorus]

You were waiting for me, adore me, you saw me
As I wish the whole world could
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could
You would lick the tears from my eyes when I cry
How I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you deceive you I needed you
I believed in you.

So I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my eye
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart

All I have are pictures and stitches and riches
But money could never buy what you give
Though my heart is achin' and breakin' I'm takin'
Most of what you send my way
I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told
I am coming back for you
I know we will be okay everyday
The sun shines a little brighter

So I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my eye
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my eye
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I'm trying not to fall apart

When in the night we'll set a light
I'm wishing with all of my mind
Oh no, I never meant to let you down
Never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I never let you down
I never meant to let you down
I'm trying not to fall apart.

Pick me up in your arms
Carry me away from harm
You're never gonna put me down
I know you're just one good man
You'll tire before we see land
You're never gonna put me down

Oh I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day you're not day too soon

Honey I will stitch you
Darling I will fit you in my heart
Honey I will meet you
Darling I will keep you in my heart

You'll risk all this for just a kiss
I promise I will not resist
Promise you wont hold me down
And when we reach a good place
Let's be sure to leave no trace
Promise they wont track us down

Now I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah, I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon

Honey I will stitch you
Darling i will fit you in my heart
Honey I will meet you
Darling I will keep you in my heart

I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon

Oh honey I will stitch you
Darling I will fit you in my heart
Honey I will meet you
Darling I will keep you in my heart

You shot me up, yeah
You filled my cup, oh
You sailed my boat
You were my last hope
You took my very last hope away

Oh you, you will be loved by someone good
And you, you will be loved by somebody good
You have been loved

You dropped the bomb
And now you're gone
I held you dear
You swallowed my fears
And now I've drunk my last beer with you

Oh you, you have been loved by someone good
Yeah you, you will be loved
Oh will you ever know
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago
Only sadness remains
And it will pass

Yeah you you will be loved by somebody good
By somebody good

I've stuck around, through thick and through thin
You cannot deny, I've always been in
But I've watched you stand, still as a snowman
But I don't see you change, you're always at meltdown

Yeah I've been your crutch, your smell sight and touch
Yeah I took you home when you've drunk too much
But I can't survive, with you by my side
See I'll never get laid, while I'm running your life

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate

So just cut me loose, learn to tie your shoes
There's somebody here, I'd like to introduce
So look in the mirror, look for the glass
?Cause you're not my problem, you are my last

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
I'm just a girl that you lost to cocaine

Come with me to a place of fantasy

Death by chocolate is myth
This I know because I lived
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl
This is only right now

Death by crying doesn't exist, though
The headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode
But you reach the end of the road
And you, little tree
I'm certain you will grow

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend

Death by anger this is true
Just let him go he can't hurt you
Oh little girl this is such a cruel cruel world
This is the first, of a million broken hearts

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend

Oh it won't be long you will grow strong
Up up and away

He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf

Someone plugged you in
And sadly they clipped your wings
Now you can't fly away electric bird
Yeah someone took your tweet
One day they fed you that bad seed
You can't fly away electric bird

Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic


Got to set you free, you were blinded by deceit
You can't fly away electric bird
So now this rooms all staged
While you're stuck there in that cage
You can't fly away electric bird

Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic

Beautiful calm driving, deep sea pearl diving
Constantly unwinding, beautiful calm driving
You turned into another
You turned into nutter
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger
To me

Beautiful calm driving, emotional hiding
Effortlessly shining, beautiful calm driving


You turned into another
You turned into nutter
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me
Beautiful calm driving

Send a wish upon a star
Do the work and you'll go far
Send a wish upon a star
Make a map and there you are

Send a hope upon a wave
A dying wish before the grave
Send a hope upon a wave
For all this souls you failed to save

And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well

Send a question in the wind
It's hard to know where to begin
So send the question in the wind
And give an answer to a friend

Place your past into a book
Put in everything you ever took
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook

And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well

Repeat chorus

Send a wish upon a star
Send a wish upon a star

You got me pushing imaginary buttons
Step away from me lover, away from me lover
You got me counting imaginary school children
Get away from me lover, away from me lover

Stealing hearts was your pastime
I saw girls falling hook line
You stole kisses and threw them aside
Hits and misses your love-side

You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better

Making waves was your hobby
And I asked you to hold me
And I knew it
You do it in front of the world
And I'll end up different from the other girls

You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better

I'm in here, can anybody see me?
Can anybody help?

I'm in here, a prisoner of history,
Can anybody help?

Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for,
You to come rescue me,
I need you to hold,
All of the sadness I can not,
Living inside of me.

I'm in here, I'm trying to tell you something,
Can anybody help?

Stuck inside these walls,
Tell me there is hope for me
Is anybody out there listening?

Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for,
You to come rescue me,
I need you to hold,
All of the sadness I can not,
Living inside of me.

It's dangerous
To fall in love, but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us
We're bristling with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire
Burn me

So come on, I'll take you on, take you on, I
Ache for love, ache for us, why
Don't you come, don't you come a little closer

Wanna put my hands through you
I'll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath
Loving you to death, loving you to death

The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassin's delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when it's time for you to die

Detonate me

Decapitate me
Hit me like a baseball
Emancipate me
Free the animal, free the animal

And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
I might have thought that we were one
Why not fight this war without weapons?
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
And let's be clear, I trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Put on my best dress, I wanted to impress
I put a little make-up on
Put a bow in my hair, wore pretty underwear
Hoping you might take it off
Don't know your etiquette
But I'm strapped to my chair
And it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming, until
You saw your chance to kill
Your chance to make history

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

You wonder why you make girls cry

Resistance is low, gonna blow a fuse

Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey Satan, paid my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land

I'm on the highway to hell
(Don't stop me)

And I'm going down, all the way down
I'm on the highway to hell

Loose lips sink ships
So come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide, so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I

I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Cruisin' on the seven seas
A pirate of my loving needs
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]
So let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it right up
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

Loose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So screw 'em off and plug 'em in
Then switch it on and start all over again

I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Ticking like a time bomb
Blowing up the fuse box
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]

Outta my way I'm a running high
Take a chance with me and give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world I know
'Cause I ain't lookin' for an overflow

Oh baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off your high heels and let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there

I'm wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) baby
I'm wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
I'm glad you got to see it all
We're rising, falling, like at sea
Your lookin' so good under me

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) to you
I'm gonna walk all over
You

Moanin' groanin' stereo
Said gimme the stage I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be the night

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over
You

I'm gonna walk all over you

Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive

Baby I got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you being so unkind?
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone?

Thoughts of you goin' through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You said that you loved me too
But tell me who was there with you

I was talking birds and you was talking bees
And was he down on his knees
Beatin' 'round the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You eaten your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you

You can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush, oh

Chew it up, spit it out
Let it all hang out,
Beating around the bush

(Yow! One, two)
Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hand off me
And give me plenty of
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, baby what's the going price?
She told me to go to hell

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no

Said, baby, you're driving me crazy
Laid it out on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy she's mine
Oh!

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame, yea yeah
To be shot down in flames

Hey you Angus, shoot me, shoot
That's nice, woo! Uh! Oh! Oh! Wooooh!

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Oh
Shot

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

I don't want the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Ohhh

I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she's got

She's stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walkin' down the street

Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
Enough to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She gives me first degree
She really satisfies me

Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War

You know I'm losin' sleep
I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

You know she moves like sin
And when she lets me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)

You know she really got the rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (rock n roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

It's criminal
There ought to be a law
Criminal
There ought to be a whole lot more
You get nothin' for nothin'
Tell me who can you trust
We got what you want
And you got the lust
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the streets
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
Yes you have

It's animal
Livin' in the human zoo
Animal
The shit that they toss to you
Feelin' like a christian
Locked in a cage
Thrown to the lions
On the second page
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the street
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
O positive

Blood on the rocks
Blood on the streets
Blood in the sky
Blood on the sheets
If you want blood
You got it

I want you to bleed for me

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive

Baby I got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you being so unkind?
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone?

Beating around the bush, oh

Chew it up, spit it out
Let it all hang out,
Beating around the bush

It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder and lightening start

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much, touch me

Seems like a touch, touch too much
You know it's much too much, much too much
I really want to feel your touch too much
Girl you know you're giving me much too much
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much too much too much

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Giving me a touch, a touch too much
Baby gotta a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much

A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch
Come on touch me
Ah

Gonna have ourselves a party

And no one's playing hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll

My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're gonna die

If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing as I split the night
Cause if good's on the left,
Then I'm stickin' to the right

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight

Love came (love came, love came) forever

You're a nurturer and a superwoman
You're every daughter that becomes a mother
And you can be my rock to the highest mountain top
From my heart to my toes, to cherish, love and hold

You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen

You're a counsellor, just like grandmas do
You're that voice, you're that push for all I dream and do
So I cherish you, like royalty
And by all means, I'll never put my hands on thee

'Cause you're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen (You gave birth)
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
You're my queen

I never want her be rid me
The merest sensitivity
See you're a grown, strong women
And I'm never gonna call you out your name
Yeah man make this and man make that
'Till the end of time, it's a well-known fact
Behind the greatest man is a virtue of a woman

You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen

You could be my daughter

My virtue of a woman
My rock, half guiding light
(You're my queen, queen, queen, queen, queen)
You're the backbone of every man, baby
I won't never, ever call you out your name baby
You're my queen, you're my call
You're my love, you're my all
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen

Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Why don't you mean it ?
Why do I follow you and where do you go
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun - begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
March to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa
A voice from behind me reminds me
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

Aah ah aah
La la la la laa
Ah ah ah ah aah
Ah la la la laa
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began

I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah





Mary queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin'
The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming
Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving
No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising

Well, I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing

The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order
But I was not born to live to die, and you were not born for queenin'
It's not to late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'

Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'
But on your bed, Mary, I can see the shadow of a noose
I don't understand how you can hold me so tight and love me so damn loose

But I know a place where we can go, Mary
Where I can get a good job and start out all over again clean
I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen





We took your body
Turned to ash
Down by the waterside
We watched the reason your dust collides

I watched the old man cry from the otherside
No, no it won't help you
No, no it won't

Lost inside a day that never happened
To feel this way again year after year
In the back of your mind
I'll find you, I'll find you-uu
In the back of your mind

Everyone holds on to someone they loved
That's how the trouble starts
That's when it falls apart
Tell me this is not the end
Of everything I've ever known
Everything I've ever known

No, no it won't help you
No, no it won't help you

Lost inside a day that never happened
To feel this way again year after year
In the back of your mind
I'll find you, I'll find you-uu
In the back of your mind

Lost inside a day that never happened
To feel this way again year after year
In the back of my mind
I'll find you
In the back of my mind





Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Why don't you mean it ?
Why do I follow you and where do you go
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun - begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
March to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa
A voice from behind me reminds me
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

Aah ah aah
La la la la laa
Ah ah ah ah aah
Ah la la la laa
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah





You never heard my song before the music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well for now we both know how
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...

Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
A misty castle awaits for you
And you shall be a Queen (you shall be a Queen)
Today the cloud, it hangs over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...

When I was you and you were me and we were very young
Together took us nearly there, the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
But some day one day...
We'll come home





Oh
Tonight I'm gonna show
Them what I'm made up for
The killer queen inside me's
Coming out
Say, "Hello!"

Oh
Tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you I'd watch them all be burnt
Whoa-Oh, Whoa-Oh

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

I can be
The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be
The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
Our dream is happening
I can be the queen

I
Wind and hurricane
The stormy sky and rain
When you run dry I'll flood your pain
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

In between the moments of
The lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rhomp-a-bump-a

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

I can be
The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be
The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
Our dream is happening
I can be the queen

The quee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-een
The que-ee-een
Quee-ee-een
Quee-ee-een

Starry night come inside me like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door
I will fly on a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

He's a fairy feller
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new moon's shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke

Plow man wagoner will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly dally oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
He's a dirty fellow
What a dirty laddie-oh

Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero ah
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow (can we see the master stroke)
What a queer fellow

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Soldier sailor tinker tailor plow boy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch magician presides
He is the leader

Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a queer fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on mister feller
Crack it open of you please

This is a song about a card game
Black queen, holding hearts
Black queen, tear the game apart
Black queen, don't you know?
Can't beat aces all in a row, black queen, no you can't
Have mercy black queen

Don't you go mess with the black queen, no
Black queen, see the whole hand
Black queen, where's your black man?
Black queen, if he ain't in the hole
Black queen, you got some more to show me, black queen
Oh, get on me black queen

Oh, Lord, have mercy, black queen
She's called to beat me clean
Black queen, where's your bank roll?
Black queen, where did it go?
Black queen, the truth is hard
Black queen, you're playin' foolish cards, black queen

I have sinned dear father, father I have sinned
Try and help me father
Won't you let me in ? Liar
Oh nobody believes me - Liar
Ooh, why don't you leave me alone ?
Sire I have stolen, stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should
Liar - oh everybody deceives me
Liar - ooh, why don't you leave me alone ?

Liar - I have sailed the seas
Liar - from Mars to Mercury
Liar - I have drunk the wine
Liar - Time after time
Liar - You're lying to me
Liar - You're lying to me
Father please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me in the right way
Liar liar liar liar
Liar that's what they keep calling me
Liar liar liar

Ooh, let me go

Listen, are you gonna listen ?
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
Mama I'm gonna try behave
All day long
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
I'm gonna serve you till your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna keep you till your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
All day long and pray
All day long and pray
All day long and pray
All day long, wow, all day long, wow
All day long, all day long, all day long
Yes, all day long, all day long, all day long, all day long, yeah
All day long, we have lift off, ow

All day long, all day long, all day long
Liar liar they never ever let you win
Liar liar everything you do is sin
Liar nobody believes you
Liar they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
So now you know you could be dead before they let you, aah

Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la

Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive yeah
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive - shake

Ow
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, c'mon
Keep yourself alive
Mm, you take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon c'mon keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied

Goodbye, Betsy, I'm goin' away
I'm sick of you and there ain't no way
Don't want to know, don't want to see
Don't you ever bother me

Sick of hanging around your pad
Sick of your Mom and sick of your Dad
Yes and Betsy, it's sad but true
Now I'm even sick of you

No way, no way, no way
No way for our love
No way for our love

Good bye, Betsy, I'm going away

Sick of your mom and sick of your dad
Yes and Betsy it's sad but true
Now I'm even sick of you

No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way for our love
No way for our love

Every evening and every day
Seem to always turn out this way
To get an end, I better find new love
Then you'll pay, then you'll pay, ain't no way
'Cause I'm sick of you

Goodbye, Betsy, I'm going away
I'm sick of you and I don't wanna stay
Don't want to know, don't want to see

Well, I live here in kill city, where the debris meets the sea
I live here in kill city, where the debris meets the sea
It's a playground to the rich but it's a loaded gun to me

Well, I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
But if I have to die here, first I'm gonna make some noise

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Turn that boy loose

Yeah, the scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
The scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
Until you wind up in some bathroom, overdosed and on your knees

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up

Uh
I played tag in the auto graveyard
I looked up at the radio tower
Rag tent by the railroad tracks
Concrete poured over steel bridge
Pondered my fate
While they built the interstate

I'm a product of America
From the morgue to the prisons
Cold metal, when I start my band
Cold metal, in my garbage can
Cold metal, gets in my blood
And my attitude

Yeah, a huh
Threw my hide in an automobile
Heard a song called "Drive the wheel"
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

This is the song of my heritage
From the bad to the Buddha

Cold metal, that's what it be
Cold metal, from sea to sea
Cold metal, it's how we win

And also how we sin
How we sin, how we sin, how we sin, how we sin

Cold metal, in the afternoon
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune
Cold metal, it's the father of beat
The mother of the street

Cold metal, it rolls on by
Cold metal, gonna raise it high
Cold metal, it'll even fly
Rust buckets in the sky

Cold metal, got to be
Skeleton of the free
Cold metal, it's gotta be
Better save a tree

Save a tree, save a tree, save a tree, save a tree
Yeah

Well I'm just outa school
Like I'm real real cool
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message that I gotta be
A wild one
Ooh yeah I'm a wild one

[Chorus]
Gotta break it loose
Gonna keep 'em movin' wild
Gonna keep a swingin' baby
I'm a real wild child

Gonna met all muh friends
Gonna have ourself a ball
Gonna tell my friends
Gonna tell them all
That I'm a wild one
Ooh yeah I'm a wild one

[Chorus]

I'm a real wild one
An' I like a wild fun
In a world gone crazy
Everything seems hazy
I'm a wild one
Ooh yeah I'm a wild one

[Chorus]

I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Oh baby
I'm a wild one

[Chorus]

You have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space

The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I don't know what's coming next

We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
I'm not a big man
It's hard to face the world

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
That would nail me to the wall

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth
It can't fall

Well, I live here in Kil City where the debris meets the sea
I live here in Kil City where the debris meets the sea
It's a playground for the rich but it's a loaded gun to me

Well, I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
But if I have to die here first, I'm gonna make some noise

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Turn that boy loose

Yeah, the scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
The scene is fascination, man and everything's for free
Until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
When we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild . . .

I've already been
Down the street of chance

I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says ... sh-sh-shhh

Things have been tough
Without the dumb dumb boys
I can't seem to speak
The language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
The whole world down

The first time I saw
The dumb dumb boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front
Of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed
Not at all
And we'd sing
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Dumb dumb day
Where are you now my
Dumb dumb boys are you
Alive or dead
Have you left me the last
Of the dumb dumb daze
Then the sun goes down
And the boys broke down

People said we were negative
They said we'd take but
We would never give
But we'd sing da-da-da
Da-da-da dumb dumb day
Da-da-da-da-da dumb
And hope it would pay
Da-da-da-da it's been
A dumdumdum day
A dumb dumb day

Now I'm looking for
The dumb dumb boys
Where are you now
When I need your noise

Now I'm looking for
The dumb dumb boys
The walls close in and
I need some noise

Well the day begins
You don't want to live
'Cause you can't believe
In the one you're with
'Cause you know her tricks
And you know her past
When she makes a face
You just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing.

So you turn around
Toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks
Who have got no past
Yea that's what you think
And you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed
Like a young banshee
And she wants for this
And she wants for that
What did you think.

Before you go
Do me a favor
Give me a number
Of a girl almost like you
With legs almost like you
I'm buried deep in mass production
You're not nothing new
I like to drive along the freeways
See the smokestacks belching
Breasts turn bronw
So warm and so brown

Though I try to die
You put me back on the line
Oh damn it to hell
Back on the line, hell
Back on the line
Again and again
I'm back on the line
Again and again
And I see my face here
And it's there in the mirror
And it's up in the air
And I'm down on the ground

By the way
I'm going for cigarettes
And since you've gotta go
Won't you do me that favor
Won't you give me that number
Won't you get me that girl
Yeah, she's almost like you
Yes, she's almost like you
And I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yeah, I'm almost like him

Sweet sixteen in leather boots
Body and soul, I go crazy
Baby, baby, I'm a hungry
Sweet sixteen

Funky bar all full of faces
Pretty faces, beautiful faces
Body and soul
Body and soul
I give to you
I am an easy mark with my broken heart
Sweet sixteen

Show you my explosion, sweet sixteen
Go out to the funky bar I get hurt, crying inside
'Cause everybody's so fine
And they don't need me

Tell me what can I do, sweet sixteen?
I give my body and soul sweet sixteen

I must be hungry
'Cause I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby
I know

That's not normal
But I love you
I love you
I love you
Sweet sixteen
Everywhere I go, I love it

Well, I never got my license to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yeah, some dumb, weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yes, some dumb weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head out on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Some weird sin
Some weird sin

I am a passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backside
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight

I am a passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripped-back sky
And everything looks good tonight

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
See the city's ripped backsides
We'll see the bright and hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine so bright
The sky was made for us tonight

Oh, the passenger
How-how he rides
Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the silent hollow sky
He see the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
'Cause it just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and see what's mine

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window's eye
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the city asleep at night
He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
Oh, let's ride and ride and ride and ride

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

I saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon, her
Young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight

Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love her till the end
I am gonna love her till the end
I will love her till I die
I will see her in the sky
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pain disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I labeled you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me

Couldn't be much more from the heart

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore
Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops in me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back to the room that's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

I can't remember anything

I know cause I've seen it
It was grey and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in the world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more

[Bridge]
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Take a lesson
From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can't change all our tactics
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on your own

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
This is the modern way
Faking it everyday
Taking it as they come
We're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
That this is the modern way?

I know where I'm going
I know we are in the knowing
I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want

[Bridge]





How could we not notice it before
Well you may as well have pinned it to my door
Well we are so slowly coming around to the fact
That this friend is a friend no more

And if you think you are right then you are wrong
No one ever really knew what's going on
Now we are all so slowly coming around
And this friend of a friend was no friend all along

The penny drops with the top of tory fell
To the cruel and bastard Taj Mahal
A penny more to the floor of Sacre Coeur
From the Spanish men to the Yorkshire moors

In nights of old, they lie in the roads.
Off with their heads, and always lead opinion polls.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.

In uniforms, of green and gold,
Like crocodiles they march in files of unison.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free.

I like it too much, I like it too much.
I like it too much, I like it too much.

[Chorus]
Cause you are, descended from animals, and you are constructed of chemicals.
The one thing you cant have, you lie too much.

You look but you cannot touch.


Like dominoes, one only goes. They all fall, sail the ship, rock the boat.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free.


I like it too much I like it too much.
I like you it much I like it too much.

[Chorus]

You look but you cannot touch.
I like it all too much.

[Chorus]

You look but you cannot touch. I like it all too much.

Yesterday you lay awake on your bed,
And worked out you?d done everything that you said,
That you knew therefore you'd got to be saved,
The lord of the bored and a slave to her (wage?)

[Chorus]
It's a mystery
Oh, it's a mystery
You want some history
Oh its a mystery

So last night you got up and out of this room,
The ceiling is peeling and covered in gloom,
Jaguar shoes is the best you deserve
Decision, a lesson you ought not to learn.

[Chorus]

Today as you shake off the drunken degree,
All that is left is the faint memory,
The downing,the drugs,all the nights on the tiles,
It?s hard to remember but totally worthwhile.

[Chorus]

It's a waste of money
You have to admit
And its a waste of money
You have to have it?

It's a waste of freedom
You have to resist
If you're wanting history
You've got it

It's a waste of money
You have to admit
And its a waste of money
You have to have it?

It's a waste of freedom
You have to resist
If you're wanting history
You've missed it

Don't stop moving
You mustn't stop moving
You can't stop moving
You must join in

Oh bit

Well, nothing I said's so important
That it can't be shortened
To fit on a badge
I wish that I could be God
Try to deliver a soundbite
But it is the catch

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean

Everybody applauds her
From the lord to the hordes
And the nation is swept
By a one-to-one conversation
In adult education
I would tell her except

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

Can't say you're unattractive
But I'm out of practice
In this sort of thing
It's not like I'm talking Italian
Or I wear a medallion
And a sovereign ring

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face
What a waste
What a face

Great things can be expressed
In fifteen words or less
And bring that to your heart
Words just don't do it justice
The world and its crust
Is still drifting apart

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

Do you know
When you go
I get all tongue tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face
What a waste
What a face

Follow the underdog
Hold on his collar tight
This city loves a scrap
One day its gonna fight

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Cant stop me from having a good day on a bad day
There's good days and bad days

Making a night of it
Breaking the barriers
Drowning the sorrows
Upset the regulars

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from getting away with
Good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days

Oh hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey
Oh hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey

(Good days and bad days)

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Sticks and stones and animal bones
There's good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days


If you had a different attitude
Instead of taking taking to
You have missed an opportunity
And that's a really big mistake
If you had a different attitude
You'd still have good days and bad days

Hey hey hey

Like a tomato in the rain
I got that feeling again
Like a greyhound in a race
I've got a rabbit to chase
Roll under me no ones going down
You got the remedy, what?s going around?

Like a beetle on its back
I've got to get back on track
Or a police man on a tape
Waiting down in the lane
If the wheel comes off your car
Hammer it and nail it or 2
Before it falls apart
Add more nails and glue

Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?

I got that feeling again

I got that feeling again

Roll around with me, no ones going down
You got our memories it all comes back around

Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?
Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?

Getting married in the morning
Its hardly peaches and cream
We haven't got a lot in common
Except the daily routine
Nothing on the television
Just the dust on the screen
So, come on lets get together
Why don't we join a team?

[Chorus]
You might as well face it you?re addicted to drugs
You might as well face it your addicted,
You might as well face it you?re addicted to drugs
You might as well face it your addicted

Greatest poet of the sixth form
Turned out to be a fraud
Man you got a lot of buddies
How do you remember them all?





Pick the one you like
Love the one you're with
You're going down the wrong road
And it doesn't even matter

A prize in every pack
Take it from the top
You're going down the wrong road
And it doesn't even matter

Remember you're a girl, remember you're a boy
Cause interesting people always spread the joy
Interesting people, get away with it

It's time to run the race
We're all on the way
Going down the wrong road and it doesn't even matter
Show up on the day
Take it all the way
You're living in the wrong time but it doesn't even matter

Forget that you're a boy, forget that you're a girl
Cause interesting people always rule the world
Interesting people get away with it
All the time

What did you learn today?
I learned nothing
What did you do today?
I did nothing
What did you learn at school?
I didn't go
Why didn't you go to school?
I don't know

It's cool to know nothing

It's cool to know nothing

Television's on the blink
There's nothing on it
I really want to really big coat
With words on it
What do you want for tea?
I want crisps
Why didn't you join the team?
I just didn't

It's cool to know nothing

It's cool to know nothing

Take a look, take a look, take a look
At the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Here comes the referee
The light's flashing
Best bit of the day
Now that's living
Why don't you run away?
Are you kidding?
What is the golden rule?
You say nothing

It's cool to know nothing

It's cool to know nothing

Take a look, take a look, take a look
At the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Take a look, take a look, take a look
At the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Watching the people get lairy
Is not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
And not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
And old Leodiensian

La-ah-ah, la la lalala la
Ah-ah-ah, la la lalala la

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

I tried to get in my taxi
A man in a tracksuit attacked me
He said that he saw it before me
Wants to get things a bit gory
Girls run around with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat, well they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

La-ah-ah, la la lalala la
Ah-ah-ah, la la lalala la

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

Watching the people get lairy
Is not very pretty I tell thee

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

It was Saturday nite, the moon was bright
Shining down, it's harvest light
Music all around to hear, set the stage
And atmosphere--many dress to suit
Their taste, participate in the ego race
Tonite's the night, for you to be
Biggest man in history

Saturday nite's your curtain call
You found your place after all
I saw a face in the crowd
Sayin' nothin', yet talking loud

Life is just a day
Living games we play
London Bridge is fallin' down
Do what Simon says
Doing what you feel,
Games can be unreal
Humpty-Dumpty when you fall
There be no one here to call
Life is stil your mystery
You see, you see, you see

Many friends, who gather 'round
In hope, to feel safe and sound
We emphasize, to make it clear
Our stumbling nations atmosphere
While looking thru the looking glass
Our vision show, a stormy past
When you gonna wake, and see the sun--
Stop wasting time and having fun

Life is just a day
Daily games we play
London Bridge has fallen down
You did what Simon said
Doing what you feel
Games are so unreal
Humpty-Dumpty why'd you fall
You see there's no one here to call
Now we've solved this mystery
You see, you see, you see





Head down, keep your head down
Keep the rent down all the time
Hold tight, to your red stripe
Why do we fight everytime
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
Night club, Marlborough Light stub
Stuck to my gob, all the time
I treat you like the see-through
I don't mean to everytime
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth

Disgraced, back to my place
I'm a complete waste of your time
I'm asleep before the first sheep
Until the last bleep of all time
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth
What did I ever

Watching the people get lairy
Is not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
And not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
And old Leodiensian

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

I tried to get in my taxi
A man in a tracksuit attacked me
He said that he saw it before me
Wants to get things a bit gory
Girls run around with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat, well they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

Watching the people get lairy

Everyday I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I've got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The Doctor says all I needs pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less
And less and less,

I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel a rat upon a wheel
I've got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digressed
Impressed you're dressed to SOS

Oh, and my parents love me
Oh, and my girlfriend loves me
Everyday I love you less and less
I can't believe once you and me did sex
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
You're turning into something I detest
And everybody says that your a mess
Since everyday I love you less and less
And less, and less

I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel a rat upon a wheel
I've got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digressed
Impressed you're dressed to SOS

Oh, and my parents love me
Oh, and my girlfriend loves me
Oh, they keep photos of me
Oh, that's enough love for me
Oh, and my parents love me
Oh, and my girlfriend loves me
Oh, they keep photos of me
Oh, that's enough love for me

I know cause I've seen it
It was grey and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in the world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more

[Bridge]
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Take a lesson
From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can't change all our tactics
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on your own

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
This is the modern way
Faking it everyday
Taking it as they come
We're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
That this is the modern way?

I know where I'm going
I know we are in the knowing
I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want

[Bridge]





One, two, one, two, three, four

It does not move me
It does not get me going at all
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not shift me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not move me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

She does not lis-ten
She's too wrapped up with all of her things
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

This does not get to me
She's not the kind of girl that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

She does not move me
She's not the kind of girl that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not move me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

It does not move me
(it does not move me)
It does not get me going at all

It does not shift me
(it does not shift me)
It's not the kind of thing that I like

It does not move me
It's not the kind of thing that I like
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa
Na na na na naa

I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus and that was that
There's more to this than passing by
There's more to this than meets the eye

I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus, I saw your shoes
They fell apart some time ago,
I'll buy some more in 5 years

[Chorus]
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing

I tell you what it's going to feel like
You've lost a limb and you can feel it
It's too late, at night, not by my side
'Cause I'm not there to hold you too tight

I tell you what it's going to be like
Well you can never hold my hand in public
They can't know or understand
That you and me are now together

[Chorus]

You can have it all if that's alright
And I will give it all to you cause you never fight
You can have it all if that's alright
And know that you can have it all if it's alright

[Chorus]

You can have it all if that's alright
And I will give it all to you cause you never fight
Before that you could have it all if that's alright
And I would give it all to you cause you never fight
Before that you could have it all if that's alright
If it's alright

You and me were made
(It's impossible to say)
To be together always
Then you moved away
(To the capital of England)
I hoped you'd stay there

Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

I came down at your
(On the national express)
Request, to touch your breasts
And now, I've found
That you, you are hanging with a crowd
A load of cheats and liars

Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Da um
Da um
Suddenly there's a knock at your head
Don't let the music come and try and take your
Ha ha ha happiness is a bowl in your hand
You've got to try and blow this party trip as far as you can

Cre Cre Cre creosote is pouring out of my brain
And tram de da do da crick in your neck
Get a room, get a head get a hat
We'll come and do the heavy where the trouble is at

Come in to the city on a Saturday night
Watching the boys on their motorbikes
I want to be like those guys, I want to wear my clothes tight
Matching jackets and a fistful of notes
New sneakers and a fresh pack of smokes

Ne ne ne nuerofen-max is a word and a mum
They're just tryin' to put the punk back into punch-a-mon
Pe pe pe pe panic over party off party on
We are birds of a feather and you can be the fat one

Come in to the city on a Saturday night
Open your heads like a satellite
I want to see what they see, I want to love you like crazy
Count your do da and you're out of your face
Can see into your room from outer space

Wa oh wa oh

Come in to the city on a Saturday night
It's not the size of the 9 til 5
I want to know what that does, I want to show you what matters
'Cause it's the size of the fire and man
that makes the difference to the size of the sham
Cut through the city on a Saturday Night
'Cause you and me are we're on the edge of the night

Cut through the city on a Saturday Night
I asked your mother and she said its alright
We're getting married when we're thirty
Gonna do it on your birthday
'Cause I don't want to waste a moment with you
I just want to live the whole night through

Cut through the city on a Saturday Night
'Cause you and me are we're on the edge of the night

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

See the stones coming at my window
See they left man no protection
T ell his family that he will be ok
K-I-LL!

Check the angles from both forces
Overcome by the need to fight it
Fight it fight it fight it fight it

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

I hear the sounds all around

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around cause the reason is treason

I say!

John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD
Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key
Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir
It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear.
Sing that.

Chew the backbone,
A solar system, these clever convicts

In union station, with a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect, he chanced him where he stand
And I don't think you realize he's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check

Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts

Making his getaway threw a punched out mirror
He blend into the crowd, hear the system scream
And all those spies that strikes your head
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those omens man, I think you better run.

Checkout.

Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts.
Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts.
Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts.

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe
All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down, I said
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

I take down what I need
Cause you know I need to breathe
I'm tired of walking on another plane
Another plane cause I feel insane, I
Step back to get to you
Cut back I'm fallin' through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down, I said
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

So keep those voices down
Even if you don't make no sound
A thousand voices makin' all the mistakes
The fire escapes and this code must break
I
Step back to get to you
Cut back I'm fallin' through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men goin' break ya down, I said
Two men goin' break ya down, I breathe

Standing here on this burning bridge
Trying to figure out but there's nothing here
Seem like they got the fear

Cattle grids rattle gold chains, pay it back
Just cancel the chickens
And tell your son, that he should steal the gold

Kings send their knights
Check these soul satellites
Test transmission
Is calling me back home

Too messed up to perform this,
Can't you see ill only miss you now and memories
They get washed to the seas

Feeding tape through the fabric must tune in
Unless you're trapped tomorrow
And get out the sun, get out before it gets you back

Kings send their knights
Check these souls satellites
Test transmission
Is calling me back home

And I feel, close enough,
Taste the change
Feel the rays,
Its gonna get you again,
Setting sun is coming back again

Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir
It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear.
Sing that.

Chew the backbone,
A solar system, these clever convicts

In union station, with a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect, he chanced him where he stand
And I don't think you realize he's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check

Chew the backbone,
A solar system, these clever convicts

Making his getaway threw a punched out mirror
He blend into the crowd, hear the system scream
And all those spies that strikes your head
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those OMENS man, I think you better run.

Coco believe me
I'm a lonesome man
I want to get stoned and trip some wires
I want to get myself underground
I said that, you must believe me
When I say I'm fightin' the dead
Lyin low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head?
But I got these voices that just keep singin' out
Sayin'
"I just can't stop losin' control"
"I just can't stop losin' control"
Said that "I just can't stop losin' control"

Trench wander pavement
Tryin' to score some love
In the corner of the city
Matching faces with fees
I guess that you never been here by the look upon ya face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race

Singin' out
"I just can't stop losin' control"
"I just can't stop losin' control"
Said that
"I just can't stop losin' control"
"I just can't stop losin' control"

I got these voices

I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire!
Ya know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire!
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
Waiting for the final trip
Come on it, get on it
I'm carving thru a letterbomb
I need it, loud potions
These drugs are just an hour away
Come on it, electronic
A polyphonic prostitute, the motors, on fire
Messiah for the animals

Ah, oh come on!
We got our backs to the wall!
Ah!
Get on!
And watch out!
Sayin, "Yer gonna kill us all!"

Ah I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire!
You know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire!
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
Messiah for the animals

Ah, oh come on!
We got our backs to the wall
Ah!
Get on!
And watch out! Ah!
Before you kill us all!

Ah, oh come on!
Say " we got our backs to the wall!"
Get on!
And watch out! Ah!
Before you kill us all!

No one else is here
And I can't get, since I'm nothing
No one else gets high
And I can't sleep cause I got nothing
Feeling I am lost
Control to a higher force

Music is my, my love

No one else is here
And I can't get, since I'm nothing
No one else comes clean

And I can't sleep, cause I got nothing
Feeling I am lost
Control to a higher force

Music is my, my love

Music is my, music is my, music is my

I sit and wait for you cause' this was never over
I hear the talk in codes
If you want me then come get me
You want me so come get me
I'm standing with my allies
Sellin' arms to strangers
Watch them shoot ya down

There aint nothin' I will say to you
But I know your eyes are fearin'
I watch as you creep by
I'll find my way, wont let go
I'll find my way, wont let go
I'm standing with my allies
Sellin' guns to strangers
Still dont let me sin






See, see how she dances with that cigarette in her hand
And she, she romances, everybody, like she can
She brings the lie and catches me again

Life, seen some wonders
I played my stupid games with you
Sing to me like I know you can
What girl would be?
And she nits a snare catches me again

I guess you know to keep on dancing
Like I know you can

We're gonna make it through
We're gonna make it through now
Cause we're gonna make it through
Cause we're gonna make it through now
And the circus leaves town
Cause we're gonna make it through
Yeah, said we can make it through now
Yeah, we're gonna make it through
I said we can make it through now
And the boys and their dreams
For the boys and their dreams
I know you can hear me

I feel like the time has come
A fearless rescue from everyone
Who made you the master?
The lady caster, I found you looking for a good time
I was out in exile perfecting my style
I knew you wanted a reaction

Hit me!
Harder!
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even!
Faster!
Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Try to keep up, you scatter brain
She will enter through your vein
Who was your creator?
The one who made you, the flame I need to heat the silver
You'd bring Gods to their knees pick out the bad seeds
Relieve the generals of theirs duties

Hit me! Harder! I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even! Faster! Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Who made you the master?
The Lady caster, I found you looking for a good time
Now this blood and glitter, it tastes so bitter
There's no retreat for I surrender

Hit me!
Harder!
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even!
Faster!
Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Cotton mouth is bleeding, one way glass deceiving
Dope me up on women and credit cards
Promise X-Ray vision and fancy cars
The tables set for the bourgeois
Better get in line with your dinner tray
Cause when it's all ran out and it's just you left
With the nut job swigging his crystal meth
And there's a constant ring of machinery
Is there a place for me in history?

Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, wishing for new years day
To shelter from the storm

Sons of time are rising, 16 minds exploding
It's the 21st century ain't it cool?
It's taught us how to eat and how to drool
And the wind up merchants are out in force
Telling you my brother to change your course
And you won't be the first to think it's wrong
When all you really want is to band a gong
Cause it's all sawn up in our misery
Is there a place for me in the history?

Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, wishing for new years day
To shelter from the storm

We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the doors and shelter from the storm

Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away, leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away, wishing for new years day
To shelter from the storm

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Hey son
I'm looking forward
You're leaning backwards
Of this I'm sure

Have you had enough?
Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt?
Well if it's warm

'Cause I am taking back what's mine
I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting

Ah
I'm waiting (ah ah ah ah ah)
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone
Or something
To take me
To take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Home bred
I've got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust
I leave no scar

You say I'm old hat
A fucking dirty rat
Call me a cliche
How right you are

'Cause I am flipping bag of bones
I am righting all your wrongs
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting

Ah
I'm waiting (ah ah ah ah ah)
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone
Or something
To take me
To take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something
I get on the dark
It's the
You was at home
Chewing a monkey brain

I am out here
I'm just a silhouette
You will never
Ever ever forget

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something
I get on the dark
It's the
You was at home
Chewing a monkey brain

Out of my garden, passed the battle cruiser
We jumped over cemetery gates
There on the wasteland, we saw the horizon
I noticed your pupils dilate

They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall

Came from the booze and the fags generation
And prayed for the mayhem to start
You said you were foolish but I saw the genius
In pulling the stitches apart

They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall
So raise your glass to the ones who have passed
And the ones that got away, oh
They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall
I saw her face, way out in space

Sink like a stone, hear no sound, time stood still
Enter the void, leave no trace where you've been

Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
And all we ever wanted to be
Was floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain under a neon noon

Hands turn to dust, psychic waves fill the air
All what we have is what we've done to what we had

Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
And all we ever wanted to be
Was floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain under a neon noon

Sink like a stone, hear no sound, time stood still
All what we have is what we've done to what we had

Switchblade smiles
They go on for miles
And will be forever
Now we stand together
There's no denials

Much too soon
For the wooden spoon
Can you hear the knocking
Now your feet are stomping
Around the room

Switch blade smiles
They go on for miles
And will be forever
Now we stand together
And fill the aisles

No way back
From a shark attack
See the eyes rollover
From behind your shoulder
And fade to black

I'm a man, a man of simple pleasures
I got all I need, so give me whiskey measures
With dyslexic eyes I'm seeing very clearly
By the way, I'm on my way
But all of my life, I've been treated like a fool
But I'm no one's fool

Here I go once again trying hard to pretend
There's a future in your man made rules
I'll be governed by the road, get to shed this heavy load
I see no future, so leave me alone in the past

I am told, the world is nearly ending
But when I look outside the birds are always singing
You throw sticks and bones
Remember every dog will have it's day, I'm on my way
But all of my life, I've been treated like a fool
But I'm no one's fool

Here I go once again trying hard to pretend
There's a future in your man made rules
I'll be governed by the road, get to shed this heavy load
I see no future, so leave me alone in the past

Go on, let the righteous guide you home to where you belong
I'll stay, listen to my favorite tunes, that's where I belong

You won't take me for a ride
I'm far too fast for you to keep up with me
You won't take me for a ride
Never catch them really need no money
(I'm not gonna be standing in the line
Waiting for you just to kick me out)
You won't take me for a ride, you won't take me for a ride
You won't take me for a ride, you won't take me for a ride

I hear voices, they tell me to stop
Why should I listen,
They've never felt the drop
They hide in corners behind the pretty girls
In their
Gold in their gold in their gold
One minute to a, one minute to a, one minute to midnight
My soul you can have it cause it don't mean shit
I'd sell it to the devil for
Another hit
And midnight is coming and I wish that you were here

I hear
Voices, echo in my brain
They don't like it cause I'm not dressed the same
They
Hunt for rabbits just like Yosemite Sam
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your
Prayers
One minute to a, one minute to a, one minute to midnight

My soul you
Can have it cause it don't mean shit
I'll sell it to the devil for another hit
And
Midnight is coming and I wish that you were here
My soul you can have it cause it don't
Mean shit
I'll sell it to the devil for another hit
And midnight is coming and I
Wish that you were here

There's no need to fall, there's no need at all
Out of control on my own trying to find my way back
How did end up here And into darkness I walk as the world goes on by
Out of control on my own trying to find
My way back
How did end up here
And into darkness I walk as the world goes on by
I hear voices they tell me to stop
I hear voices they tell me to stop
I
Hear voices they tell me to stop
I hear voices they tell me to stop

Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...
Then in the middle came Motion Man...
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping way

And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below

And I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party

All for shake and made eye contact
Party control showing all that
Northeast, southwest coast
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it

A sleek skin I never nerved you
You felt lovin, I never applied a room
Without bringing the plan
By any means and means of leaving you teens,
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt

One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl

And I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all those times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy

And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said and make it expel
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter..
In the end

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes....

Hybrid
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekanetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhymes jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways write with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Ment to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound

Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land
Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest
Then I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through time
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen
A telepath of the another verse with no postage
Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage

Linkin Park [being scratched over, and over again]

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in the air's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(It watches everything)
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(It watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
But you'll find that out anyway
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast

(Forfeit the game) (you live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)

Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on.
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.
It's all too much to take in.
I can't hold on.
To end things watching everything spin.
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on.
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.
It's all too much to take in.
I can't hold on.
To end things watching everything spin.
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

How do you think
I've lost so much
I'm so afraid
I'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I watch how the moon
sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors and then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Shut up

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

There's a place so dark you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and its dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

Pushes me away

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So, even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you

You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight.

I would like to introduce

Mr. Hahn!

Let's hear it for the great

Mr. Hahn!

And now for a lesson in rhythm management, let's begin!

Alright now!
Wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else!

It goes a one, two, three

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more

Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust.

Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn,
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray,
I'll be watching far away
Right to left and left to right

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left lone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end and if you need a friend,
There's a seat here alongside me

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Whoa, whoa

No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

Victimized, victimized, never again victimized
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound comes higher on this violent rhythm
These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin'
Wanna talk about a victim, I'ma put you there with 'em!

Victimized, victimized, never again victimized
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
For you to see

Tearing me apart
With words you wouldn't say
Suddenly tomorrow's
Moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
We both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted
Secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Well it's time to begin as the summer sets in
It's the scene
You set for new lovers
You play your part painting in a new start
But each gate will open another

June, July and August said
It's probably hard to plan ahead
June, July and August said
It's better to bask in each others

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the summer go on and on

Well they tried to stay in from the cold and wind
Making love and making their dinner
Only to find that the love that they grew in the summer
Froze

February, April said
Don't be fooled by the summer again
February, April said
That half of the year, well we'll never be friends

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the winter go on and on

Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper
Seasons wait for your nod

Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born oh oh oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups oh oh oh

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old

I've got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house oh oh oh
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done oh oh oh

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old dirt road
Rambling rose (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well I'm sold

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let it die and get out of my mind
We don't see eye to eye
Or hear ear to ear

Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss?
And see this for what it is
That we're not in love

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade away, away, away

And after all it won't take long to fall in love
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
The tragedy starts from the very first spark
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

The evening was long
My guesses were true
You saw me see you
That something you said
The timing was right
The pleasure was mine

The time and the place
The look on your face
Sincerest eyes
If you're ready or not
The state of our hearts
There's no time to take

When we started
Both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening

We were caught by the light
Held onto the day
'Till it became hours
The minutes went by
The cab is outside
There's no time to take

When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

When we started both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening
When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

In my leisure suite
Quit talking
Just talking
Please

In my leisure suite
Sometimes
I feel the room surround me
With possibility

Build fires to stoke them
Let's fix what's been broken
Words have been stolen
But silence is golden

In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there

Don't come knocking
This doors for locking
Have you got the key

In my leisure suite
Hang up your jacket
Undo my back zip
Please

Moonlight on blanket
It's great when your backlit
Features in close-up
The moment we woke up

In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there

In our leisure suite
Come lie next to me
We can be complete
And do what we do when we're there

In my leisure suite

In my leisure suite

Water water on the seeds
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross Seven Seas

Maybe maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely lonely that is you
Lonely lonely that is you

Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely that is me
Lonely lonely that is me

Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tell of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

By my only things are clear
Baby boy I'm staying here
Lonely lonely that was you
Lonely and so untrue

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, for what you're trying to do

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
I ain't no vision, I am the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in my lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm

I ain't no vision, I am the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Don't try to tell me that it's over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No girl could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I am the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out

Inside and out

Inside and out

Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I should ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know

When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was held in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know

Secret heart
What are you made of
What are you so afraid of
Could it be
Three simple words
Or the fear of being overheard
What's wrong

Let her in on your secret heart

Secret Heart
Why so mysterious
Why so sacred
Why so serious
Maybe you're
Just acting tough
Maybe you're just not bad enough
What's wrong

Let her in on your secret heart

This very secret
That you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one
You're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel

Secret heart come out and share it
This loneliness, few can bear it
Could it have something to do with
Admitting that you just can't go through it alone

Let her in on your secret heart

This very secret
That you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one
That you're dying to reveal
Go tell her how you feel
This very secret
Go out and share it
This very secret

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
La vie c'est epatant

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
La vie je la comprends

N'allez jamais trop vite
Vous aurez tout le temps
Attention a la dynamite
Prenez garde au volcan, a ces gens enerves
Qui ne savent pas aller

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
En flanant gentiment

N'allez jamais trop vite
En aimant simplement
Pour avoir de la reussite
Soyez tres tres prudent
L'amour alors viendra
Se blottir dans vos bras

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Toujours, tout doux, tout doucement
Comme ca
En flanant gentiment
En souriant gentiment
En flanant gentiment
Tout doucement

Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born oh oh oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups oh oh oh

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old

I've got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house oh oh oh
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done oh oh oh

How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old dirt road
Rambling rose (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well I'm sold

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let it die and get out of my mind
We don't see eye to eye
Or hear ear to ear

Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss?
And see this for what it is
That we're not in love

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade away, away, away

And after all it won't take long to fall in love
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
The tragedy starts from the very first spark
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

The evening was long
My guesses were true
You saw me see you
That something you said
The timing was right
The pleasure was mine

The time and the place
The look on your face
Sincerest eyes
If you're ready or not
The state of our hearts
There's no time to take

When we started
Both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening

We were caught by the light
Held onto the day
'Till it became hours
The minutes went by
The cab is outside
There's no time to take

When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

When we started both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening
When we parted
Moving on
And believing
It could begin and end in one evening

Water water on the seeds
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross Seven Seas

Maybe maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely lonely that is you
Lonely lonely that is you

Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely that is me
Lonely lonely that is me

Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tell of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

By my only things are clear
Baby boy I'm staying here
Lonely lonely that was you
Lonely and so untrue

Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I should ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

Where was I

Well it's time to begin as the summer sets in
It's the scene
You set for new lovers
You play your part painting in a new start
But each gate will open another

June, July and August said
It's probably hard to plan ahead
June, July and August said
It's better to bask in each others

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the summer go on and on

Well they tried to stay in from the cold and wind
Making love and making their dinner
Only to find that the love that they grew in the summer
Froze

February, April said
Don't be fooled by the summer again
February, April said
That half of the year, well we'll never be friends

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the winter go on and on

Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper

All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met...

You know its time that we grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way...

All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it...

The requested track is not viewable.

Way down
I've been way down
Underneath this skin
Waiting to hear my name again

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
If I hear them calling
And nothing can hold me

Way down (Do you really want me?)
All the way down (Do you really want me?)
I will hear your voice (Do you really want me?)
But I'll no longer understand (No one's really loved me)

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling

I was looking to the sky
When I knew I'd be swimming home
And I cannot betray my kind
They are here, it's my time

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me (Do you really want me?)
I adore you still
But I hear them calling, (calling)
And nothing can hold me

Everything is so dark
And I know there's something wrong but I can't turn the light on
In that split second change when you knew we couldn't hold on
I realized I lived to love you

Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I remember

I won't give up on you
I can feel you in my heart, just show me the way
I don't belong here
Alone

I can still see your face
Where it's burned into my mind I die every time
I close my eyes, you're always there

Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back home

All across the ocean
We are calling, calling

Are, are you there?
Nothing left for me till I find you because it's

All gone the only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back
I, I can never go back home

Don't want to be the one to walk away
But I can't bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost

Can't find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Oh, we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven, help me find a way to dream within this nightmare

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
I remember why I know this place

I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me

Well, as much as it hurts,
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

I'm not afraid
I push through the pain
And I'm on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way even without wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
And we've gone to the end of the dream

Embrace the silence
'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes

Oceans between us
And there's nothing that can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison of every fall
Every breath, our ways to heal

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes

Someday you'll know the peace
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself
Will save us from the truth

Screamin' out
Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes

I've been believing in something so distant as if I was human
And I've been denying this feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me

All the promises I made just to let you down
You believed in me, but I'm broken
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

As much as I'd like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as I'd like to feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you

I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

Run away, run away
One day we won't feel this pain anymore
Take it all the way
Shadows of you
'Cause they won't let me go

So I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

Alone, and lost in paradise

It's too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world
Is tearing apart at the seams
We can't wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday
I'm waking up in someone else's life

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

Not gonna let this day go by
I'm gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it til there's nothing left
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

The water's rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this lie

Make me whole again, open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows of your lie
Cold and far away like you're not even mine
Undo everything and take me higher
Never believing what they say 'cause I'm

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I'm not giving in, I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away, I can't let you go
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below
Over and over in my mind

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I am so lost without my place inside your heart
I won't survive I need to know you hear me
Awaken and release my love

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I will wander 'til the end of time, torn away from you

I pull away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander 'til the end of time
Torn away from you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
Or from my hard heart

I can't go on living this way
And I can't go back the way I came
Shamed of this fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander 'til the end of time
Half a life without you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us, change, open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long, oh so long
Say goodbye, goodbye

My heart is broken
Release me, I can't hold on
Deliver us, my heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us, my heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold

Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away

I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me, but it's not enough

Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me, but it's not enough

Not that I so different
Not that I don't see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how could I forgive you?
You've changed
And I'm a liar by your side
I'm about to lose my mind

'Cause I've been screaming looking inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

You've been dreaming
If you're thinking
That I still belong to you
I've been dying,
'Cause I'm lying to myself

Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

Give me a reason to believe that you're gone
I see your shadows so I know they're all wrong
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me but I'm taking you home

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on

Some say I'm crazy for my love, oh my love (my love)
But no bonds can hold me from your side, oh my love
They don't know you can't leave me
They don't hear you singing to me

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
And I can't love you anymore than I do

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
And I can't love you anymore than I do

"People die, but real love is forever"





Speak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
I've just learned not to hear
Don't waste your time

It's never enough for you baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone

Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair
Don't waste your time

It's never enough for you baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made to tear up my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember when you've long forgotten me

It's never enough for you baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone

It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone

Do what you, what you want
If you have a dream for better
Do what you what you want
Till you don't want it anymore (Remember who you really are)

Do what you, what you want
Your world's closing in on you now (It isn't over)
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)
Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe we can break through

Do what you, what you want
You don't have to lay your life down (Is it over?)
Do what you what you want
Till you find what you're looking for (Got to remember who you really are)

But every hour slipping by screams that I have failed you
Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe

There's still time, close your eyes
Only love will guide you home
Tear down the walls and free your soul
Till we crash we're forever spiraling down, down, down, down

Hello, hello, it's only me
Infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to learn forgiveness

Hello, hello remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe we can break through

Remember who you really are
Do what you want, you want

[Segment III - Of sheer perseverance]

A solace erupts at dusk fall of my shame.
Inhuman shade of glory.
I overwhelm the kingdoms at the surface...
The new culture inherited; fashions the high
Throne...

Alone in front of the Stone!
The Tome dwells...
Along the folded Manuscript!
The Siglas immune the concealed Name.
Vannished of the plane I've bannished.
Vannished of the plane I've vannished.
Bannished of the plane I've bannished.
Bannished of the plane I've vannished.

... The dust,... The dust,
... The dust restrains from my bones onto its
Ground.
The core collapses into... The length of my once
Belonged living.
The lifetime shrouded after the silence of my
Treeve...
The layer of the unknown Nights engulfs the sha-
Pen figure of a Master.
... Mounted by ascendancy!
The infinitude that my wingspread unfolds...
... Governs my blind spheres!
Visibility enclosed!
The emptiness extends openly...
... Of sheer evanescence!
Lonely...
Lonely, I'm Immortal!

Turn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breathes free
My heart is high as the waves above me
Don't need to understand
Too lost to lose
Don't fight my tears, cause they feel so good
And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

Look past the end
It's a dream, as it's always been
All life lives on if we've ever loved it

And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

Hollow like you don't remember me
Underneath everything I guess I always dreamed
That I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
But I can't save you from yourself

[Chorus]
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life?
How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear?
Holding you down until you're

Frozen
I can't let you fall apart
You don't even know
What you've done to me
But I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
If you could just wake up

[Chorus]

All alone, all alone
And drowning in your past
Take it back, take it back
I still believe you can

Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life? How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear?
Holding you down till you disappear

It's taking you too long to decide
And I don't want to be the one, the one
Crying over wasted time

If you think you're strong enough to let me in
Then come on, stand up and be honest, be honest
I'm tired of feeling so alone
'Cause you won't let me understand
I don't wanna pretend, I wanna feel, I want to love

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

Whenever you're around, I can't fight it
You get under my skin the way that I like it
And I can't take anymore
Tell me what you want from me or leave me alone
'Cause I'm all caught up and I'm losing control

I'm tired of holding on so tight
When you won't let me understand
Now I'm falling apart
I never meant to lose myself

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real
Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

Like drops of rain against my heart
Cut through like silver
And I want to make you feel that way
And I want to make you feel the way that I do

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real?
Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never, tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me

(I'm going under)

Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
I'm dying again

I'm going under, (going under)
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under, (going under)
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm

So go on and scream
Scream at me I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under

I'm dying again
I'm going under, (going under)
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
I've got to break through, I'm going under
Going under
I'm going under

How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside, bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me

I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
I've got to open my eyes to everything

Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul

Don't let me die here
There must be something wrong, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Long lost words whisper slowly to me
Still can't find what keeps me here
When all this time I've been so hollow inside
I know you're still there

Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I won't let you pull me down

Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head

Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching me

Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you, loving you
I won't let you pull me down

I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
It was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling

It's a heartache
Nothin but a heartache
Hit you when its too late
Hit you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feelin like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Lovin till your arms break
Then he let you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care
For you

It ain't wise to need someone

As much as I depended on
You

Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I've got a feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I don't know how I'll get down the stairs

Well it's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile on my face
When I'm going all over the place

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family comes all crawling
Slaps you on the back and saying
Please, please

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
I don't think I can take anymore

Well, clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I am stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you

He said, 'I've seen you before.'
As the band broke into Misty
I put one hand on the bar
The whole room by then
Was starting to spin

I said, 'you've got Hemingway's eyes.'
And that night I called him papa
It seems that there are so many lovers
Who hold you and yet
Whose name you forget

[Chorus]
Dance, they said
Life is only for the moment
The light is brief
Don't waste it
The taste is sweet, so taste it
So I said 'I understand
I'm dancing as fast as I can.'

Maybe we're just shooting stars
Needing something to hold on to
But each thing we touch seems to vanish
Like candles and friends
They burn at both ends

[Chorus]

He said, 'I'll see you around.'
And as I brushed my hair
I winked and said, 'you might.'
'Cause I know by now how it's done
After all the mornings after
And all the nights

[Chorus]

I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me

(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

I can see
You're slipping away from me
And you're so afraid
That I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
And let you go your way

Love is gone
There's no sense in holding on
And your pity now
Would be more than I could bare
But I'm gonna be strong
And pretend I don't care

I'm gonna be strong
And stand as tall as I can
I'm gonna be strong
And let you go along
And take it like a man

When you say it's the end
I'll hand you a line
I'll smile and say
Don't you worry I'm fine
But you'll never know darling
After you kiss me goodbye
How I'll break down and cry

There you are standin' with those teardrops in your eyes
Tellin' me you're sorry for things you've done
I've heard that same old story so many times before
I know what you're doin' and I know where you're stayin' at night

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Here I am waiting like a fool I've always been
Hopin' maybe someday you will change
The same old lies you tell me are the same old lies you live
I know what you're doin' and I know where you're sleepin' at night

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you hangin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, hey

You make me feel good
You make real good love, good, good love
You make me think about
Never being without you, way too much

My heart just can't wait, I can't think straight
I want to be with you all the time
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

Come on, baby, you make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine

You've got that something
You've got me coming back for more, that's for sure
You've got me under a spell
Wondering if you're gonna tell me, say, hey baby, I'm yours

My heart just cannot wait, I can't think straight
Just wanna be with you all the time
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

Come on, baby, you make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, all mine
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine

Each day that goes by, I want to be close by your side
Each time I'm with you I find I just lose my mind
I feel strange, I feel things like
This must be love of some kind

My heart just will not wait, I'm gonna celebrate
Just waiting for you to give me a sign
You make me want you
You make me want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

Just want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Oh, mine
(You make me want to make you)
Mine, mine, mine

Oh, come on, baby
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine, mine, all mine?
(You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

I really want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine, mine, all mine?
(You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

I really want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine, mine, all mine?
(You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)

I really want to make you mine
(You make me want to make you mine)
Won't you be mine?
(You make me want to make you

Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you

Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you

Guess I should accept the call
But I really don't know what to say
The operator wont let me talk at all
And she says you want me to pay
Oh well it ain't nothin new
It fits right with my picture of you
But tonight you're gonna find out
What these tears are all about

[Chorus]
'Cause this old flame went out
You never thought you'd be the one
In the darkness now
I think you know what I'm talkin about
This old flame went out

You went to get cigarettes
That was last July, you didn't get home yet
And now you expect me to hear you out
You call me collect, there ain't no doubt

[Chorus]

What do you mean, how can I do this to you?
Lets not forget who walked out on who

[Chorus]

Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I've got a feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I don't know how I'll get down the stairs

Well it's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile on my face
When I'm going all over the place

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family comes all crawling
Slaps you on the back and saying

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
I don't think I can take anymore

Well, clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I am stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you

Midnight,
and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line

Moonlight,
you're just a heartache in disguise;
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
if it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie,
thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts

Once I had a heart cold as ice
Love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun

Once I had a trick up my sleeve
And a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young boy I found

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love

Well who'd have thought that someone like you
Could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit

Listen to the story 'bout the man who tried
To drink from the river 'til the river ran dry
He drank so long and he drank so hard
The river ran dry and it broke his heart

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side 'til he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Pricked by a thorn and heart will bleed
Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side
A fool will drink 'till the river runs dry

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love (never runs)
River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Listen to the story 'bout the man who tried
To drink from the river 'til the river ran dry
He drank so long and he drank so hard
The river ran dry and it broke his heart

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side 'til he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Pricked by a thorn and heart will bleed
Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side
A fool will drink 'till the river runs dry

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love (never runs)
River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

(Verse 1)
There are times when you fell like you can't go on
There are times when you fell like giving in
And there are times when you feel like you can't try anymore
There are times of trouble in believing
This test of your faith will last
As long as it takes to pass
Till you have no more doubt you'll endure
And you faith will emerge true and pure

(Chorus)
No doubt it'll be alright
With God it'll all work together for good
No doubt in the end it will be understood
No doubt it'll all work out
With faith He can move any mountain for us
No doubt in the power of Jesus
And after all is done we find out
All we really need to have is no doubt

(Verse 2)
There's a time to take a reckless leap of faith
There's a time to be cautious and wait
And there's a way of learning from the past
That this time of trouble won't last
And sometimes we want to think we know
The ways He will choose to make us grow
But it's never the way of our choosing
And we can't always see what He's using

(Repeat chorus)

There will be winters in the seasons of our soul
With a cold and bitter wind that chills our lives
But our faith can be building a fire
That will warm us till spring time arrives

(Repeat chorus)

time to blackout no doubt

I don't know what it is about you
There's something special in your way
Yeah every time that I'm around you
I feel it when you're there
I fell it anywhere in the world that you are
Where we're hanging so low
Yes there's no

No doubt about it
Yes there's no

I've been around so many lovers
So many faces in my time
You've got that something I ain't had yet
If you want me I will say
If it's right then I'll say
Never had love so fine

Say what is yours will be mine

At the end of the day you are worn out, you are
Worn out, and too tired to sleep
But then you do dream of wonderful things
That you might do, right on through to the next
Day
And then you wake up
The sun's on your face
You're stretchin' while you're sayin'
It's a Brand New Day!

It's a brand new day and the sky is clear
So let's come together, everybody cheer
Come out people from everywhere
Let's see your faces, the day we'll share
Come on and celebrate a Brand New Day
Everyday!

Call out to the workers and the children in the
Schools
It's a day of celebration so put down your tools
And
Celebrate a Brand New Day Everyday!

Come see the mountains and come see the
Shores
Mother nature is calling so come climb aboard
And
Celebrate a Brand New Day Everyday! Let's go

At the end of the day there is no doubt you are
Worn out
Ooh but then you do dream of wonderful things

Wonderful things you might do

And then you wake up
The sun's on your face
You're stretchin' while you're sayin'
It's a Brand New Day!

Celebrate a Brand New Day, Everyday!
Celebrate a Brand New Day, Everyday!

Some chickens crossed the road
Straying far from the hen
Five reached the side one step below Zen
One was a female  four were mad men
Who moved on,  moved on,  moved on
Joined hands and moved on

Standing in line and falling asleep
Building a fence while we're counting the sheep
We'd let you help out but our project's too deep
Move on  move on  move on
Stay awake  just move on

[Chorus]
You have to understand that when it comes to making music
We meshed the styles of five alive and intertwined and fused it
Life comes from life and through our strife we strove to make the sound true
Compelled to spell it out, (No Doubt!) in search of what we must do

Our house was to small so we had to move
The neighbors had much doubts so we had to prove
That our soulful dimensions were true to the groove
We, moved on, moved on, moved on
To our house in the middle of our street

Water the music, plant the seeds in the pot
Music is life flowing through, is it not?
Don't forget your roots, but also don't rot
Move on, move on, move on
Plant the seeds and move on

[Chorus]

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings show
Wear your heart on your sleeve,
And let yourself glow, yeah

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings show...ow-ow
Wear your heart on your sleeve,
Your heart on you sleeve,
And let yourself glow, yeah

Oh
Oh
Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings, yeah,
Your heart,
And let yourself glow, yeah
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Oh

Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say,boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby
I'm the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit, lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty ways

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

[Chorus]
All the boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you had enough you'll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls want to get with the boys
And the boys really like it

[Chorus]

Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and no doubt
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
After wards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies(that's right)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
After wards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies(yea man)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
If no, no maybe, hey

Woke up this morning and felt not too cool
'Cause every time I tried to make my mouth move
The pain I'm having
Is so discomforting
Please make this suffering go away

I told my mom what I was feeling
And how long I've been dealing with it
I knew it was coming
But didn't know how soon
She said I've reached another adolescent monsoon

the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
the pain is horrendous
Why don't you lend a helpin' hand

He was a well-educated man,
Had his degree in medicine
I noticed his hairy hands
He was a very, very hairy man
He looked right down in,
Shook his head and then said
"These teeth must be pulled right away!"

the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand
the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand

He turned around,
Rolled up his sleeve
I rolled my eyes and suddenly
A horrible pain grew, the next thing that I knew
The doc had pulled my wisdom teeth...OUT!

Well along with my teeth my money also left me
As he made out the bill, I was moaning
the pain is tremendous
Where the hell is my prescription
Of codeine?

Ooh, but when will I speak, how long until
My mouth Feels natural?
How long will they bleed, when will heal?
Where's a real meal?

How do you feel? [Repeats]

I feel good
I feel great
There's no pain
There's no ache
I feel good
I feel great
Just let me recuperate

I feel good
I feel great
There's no pain
There's no ache
I feel good
I feel great
Just let me recuperate-ate-ate-ate

Because the codeine
Has left me drowsy,
Leave me be
Just let me sleep!

Get on the ball!

Please Miss Fried
He don't mean to be mean
He just needs to leave
He hopes he does not
Cause you inconvenience
Why can't you see?

He says "please don't be sad for me"

Oh Miss Fried
Please believe you're his queen
He must fight for his dreams
Lovely Miss Fried
He will too miss you
He just needs to be free

He says  "If I should ever cause you to
Bleed don't pretend to be naive"

Don't be naive

Don't take him wrong, let him be
Sometimes he feels like he ought to be alone-lone
Don't take him wrong, let him be
Sometimes he feels like he ought to be alone-lone

He says, "Please don't be sad for me"
"Please don't be sad for me"

I'm not your doormat  your floormat
So don't wipe your feet on me
I'm not the only Garibaldi
There's more fish in the sea
I'm not your puppy  your goldfish
So don't treat me like your pet
Hey  I'm not your butterfly
So don't chase me with your net

I'm not your kneaded eraser
So don't you wear me down
I'm not your sledge  (uh!) sledge hammer
I'm no tool that you pound
I'm not your blacktop  for hopscotch
So don't jump all over me
I'm not the place where the dogs roam
At the bottom of the tree

Don't you treat me like I have no feelings
Don't you treat me like that, I have feelings
Don't treat me like that
Don't you treat me like that

Like the gum on your shoe,
I'm not the ring 'round your finger
Nor am I wrapped around you
I'm not your shoe string, your rope thing
Don't tie me in a knot
I'm not your asphalt, with oil spots
So don't use me as a parking lot

Don't you treat me like I have no feelings
Don't you treat me like that, I have feelings
Don't you treat me like I have no feelings
Yeah

Sometimes sunshine
Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes I find myself blind
At first I cannot see and then I see it's me
I chose a road when I was young
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter

Sometimes I hide somewhat
Like a bulb behind a shade
And sometimes I ask myself why
Is it 'cause the lights are too bright
Or because my eyes are closed too tight

Sometimes I find myself blind
Don't use my brain don't use my mind
Distorted feelings always leading my way
But I must forgive myself and let the past lay
Down to rest
And I'll be prepared to face myself in another
Day , hey

From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved

Sometimes sunshine
Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes, sometimes
I get lost, I get lost

I chose a road when I was young
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter oh hey

From now on I will behave

Yes, MGD is the beer for me
Ah, MGD is the beer for me, that's right
MGD is the brew for me, that's right, yeah

I'm the Q to the U to the I to the K, okay?
Each day, I play my way, that's the fly way
And I'm older than a motherfucker, but they still ask me
For my ID, when I buy MGD, feel me?

'Cause I've got [Incomprehensible] in my family, uh huh
And I've got bitches that's finer than Vanity, hmm
Plus I'm not living above my means, buying Rolexes and rings
Flossing cars that I can't afford, lovin' these bitches and whores

You know, I never broke myself to see no hoe
Never did time, never took no pride in bein' cruised
Don't give a fuck about a pink slip, loose lips, sink ships
Hundred miles at least, when I sign a new lease

I never trick off my fanny with these bitches
You got to be clever, gots to keep your mind on your riches
And stop doin' the things that keep you broke
And keepin' niggaz names in your mouth
That you shouldn't have spoke, no doubt, I'm dope

In this game eight years, some of my peers have moved on
I proceed to succeed, I've stayed within my zone
I'm the baddest motherfucker, yet it's me that you despise
Look within yourself and find out why you wear that dumb disguise

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

From the low bottoms to the skies, I got 'em open
On the scrotum they blowin' like it's chronic, high hopin'
The P never leaves, be conceivin' 'em like intercourse
Up in somethin', keep 'em comin', Playa Hamm be the source

Of the force you now witness, and this is just
Another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin', P clique swangin' down the shore

Tricks out here, tryin' to make hits instead of makin it hard hittin'
And perpetratin' frauds when they spittin'
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders, you know

What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin' P's, players, we be the essence
For life, it's the JB and pimpin' Carl
When LTD we havin' it all, no doubt

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

Now I'ma tell ya straight up, one nigga planned on havin' hands on
Messin' with what I stand on, but trick you find to get ate up
I feel like a [Incomprehensible] but this pimp ahead of me
Has [Incomprehensible] to within an inner trace of the mind
Disintegrates her kind like battery acid

You never got no money from a hoe or seen my max
[Incomprehensible] buddy be somethin' broke
I'm a pimp, but you don't know
You better stand up, now empty out your purse I told you
Get out, I don't trust your ass, now throw your hands up

Take it to the bump-bump-be-ba-dump
Dip, give me my chips, witchcraft
Now let me see what I can check you with now

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in your eyes
And tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does

Ho, what, you can't see me with it, why, probably 'cause
I stay G'd up from the street up
And subject to make your trick, go get it

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now let my man press like some dookie in your mouth

DJ Quik, Hi-C, Tony Lane, stay in somethin'
Playa Hamm, oh, Bubba Brown, Clue Dog, Peter Gunz as well
El DeBarge, what's up, baby?
Ain't nothin' but a party up in here, yeah
See my fingernails done, baby
Ahh, watch how your pants feel damp, look out, girl

My life is everything
That feeds my thirst that causes sin
My wants are all I care
No shame and guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you, oh oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh

My self I'm centered in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
It's black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees

There's no defense, you'll do what I please, oh-oh!
As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh
As I climb onto your back, I promise not to sting
I tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
'Cause you knew all along I am a scorpion, ya!

My lies, to reach the shore
I aggrandize and nothing more
My hopes, to steal away
All that you love, I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain I deal is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man

In night, inside, at night
No whispers, no worries, no words
Just light fills the corner of your eye

Take me in,        take me in

Cold sky, dark Montana, long road
Running fence, radio, trucks blow by
Up high, no air, big dreams
Take me back, take me back



I want to show you everything, everything
I want to give you everything, everything

There's a chance now and then, now and then
No more cut and run, No more cut and run

Blue night, blue world, tracking you
I'm a scorpion and I'm coming after you
Running out of darkness and time
Looking for you, looking for you

Gonna sting you with a kiss from my lips
Gonna sting you with a piece of my mind
Gonna sting you with a taste of my skin
Then you're mine, then you're mine

repeat chorus

[Eve]
They usually hate her when she comes around
Huh, first lady mobbin' nigga hit the ground
Next break into that who we what a sound
Heads bopping, never fails once the Doc's around
Hating the fact that she do things on both sides
But never disrespect two rings round both eyes, right?
Lady like in many ways
Because in trust I can be crazy like on any day
Some do they dirt but best believe in time they pay
Do believe in letting shit chill til the promised day
Huh, seems they just fade away
I love it 'cause them clowns they just paved the way
Left it wide open got no time to play
Mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay
Considered snobby then just hate me I don't give a fuck
Considered sloppy to me you just need to give it up...

Eve don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is
Eve is the hottest bitch
That's what it is
But she goin' stay ladylike
That's what it is
But I'ma act crazy like
That's what it is
Think I got your house shot
That's what it is
Think I got your car burnt
That's what it is
Think I got your people robbed
That's what it is
'Cause we don't give a fuck about you
That's what it is

[Styles]
I ain't got a moment to waste
I'm trying to get to your head, so I gotta make room in your face
And they can't see your eyes or your nose
Why P? 'cause 4, 5 slugs is consuming the space
This is Holiday you need, you fuck with the Scorpion
I don't stop popping 'til your body don't breathe
Clap more than the audience, after the show
Stab more than the butcher, and I'm kinda righteous
So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push ya
She the First Lady, I'm the ghost with the gun
Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy
Ruff Ryding the clique, come up outta your shit
Get clapped in the wig, sold alot of records
But we never gave a fuck so it's a wrap for the kids
Gat to the back and the ribs
We the hood, even Holiday bitch that's what it is

[Chorus]

[Eve]
Broke out and got grown, holdin her own
That bitch come strong, give up, dead wrong
I don't even fuck around 'less your head strong
Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown
Can't figure her out
Is she street, sweet, gutter, I'm from the hood
A lot of y'all niggas gold
This bitch two million sold
And I just figured that I'd make it known
Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone
Watch me rock, got my lip cocked
Spit fire, watch it better duck, you stuck, you crossfire
Thought you was the realest you said you caught liar
Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you

[Chorus]

It's too late to change
Always the same
I can't decide
Too hard too find

Too late to change
Always the same
I can't decide
Too hard too find

It's too late to change
I can't decide

It's too late to change
Always the same
I can't decide
Too hard too find

You've been walking down the highway
Your coming into your home
As you drown in your pool of madness
Your never gonna be alone
That's why I'm here

Look up child and love your savior
The scorpion is in my eyes
Its time to strip our souls naked
The freedom of all disguise
When you take me aside
To become an immortal
The warmth's of the flesh now
Are gonna set you free

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion

I ain't the creator and I ain't satan
I come from another place
Trust with me your fingers baby
There's eternity on my face
This world ain't big enough for your questions
I deal with the stars now just to get you right

It's time you suck the cock of the Fire God

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion
The scorpion

Midnight candy four cups of coffee
I ate my breakfast with a side of eggs
I saw something in the jungle
Low in gear black mud on my legs

She was something stretch before me
Her arms into wings into pillbox heads
Can the side show wherever you go
Two naked figures in my breath

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Yeah alright
Said it's alright
Yeah alright

Alright
Said it's alright
Yeah alright

A blue light shindig well I'm addicted
Killing black kettle is what they saw
I feel like something in the congo
Dead were the women not the warriors

Last great road show a canvas tilt go
Arms into wings into pillbox heads
Creep the high-go and keep the down low
Into the mind of a melting man

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Can you see it?
If you feel it
The scorpion sleeps right in my hand
A poison dealer
An evil wheeler
How can I make you understand?

Fishes and Scorpions
In the morning sun
Dance to the changing seasons
Get away with none

Water sign in the air
Touch the earth with flame
See the friendly Sagittarian
Do you remember his name

Lovers of lions
Stay away at feeding time
Is all the Taurus takes
Mimicking life in rhyme

And can you tell me
What does it do for you girl
And can you tell me
Who is that you knew girl

In the shadow of star shine
Everyone's going blind
Lookout you don't lose your mind
I don't know if it's a fantasy
It don't mean too much to me

In the shadow of star shine
Everyone's going blind

Gemini lady
Did you see me chasing you
I don't think I did
I only tried to get through

Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of why'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of why'all ain't writin' well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta why'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

They want to bank up, crank up
It's been a week?
Shank up, haters want to come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path want to smile ?after me

Now while you grittin' your teeth
Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishin' I wrote your lines

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin', sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-are-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Dancin' much, get it all? now I'm complete, uh huh
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double are, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Uh, c'mon, uh, yo, yo

Damn she flipped it, when gone they missed it
Been on cause, they can't stop her climb
Nigga you digs it?
Want that, well you can keep that
Cause other bitches out there wack but you can't see that
E-v is top notch, i had to spot watch
To make sure i made it mine
Cause you can't cock block, came up
Fucked the game up
Now your record sales is weak but you can't blame us
Cause none can tame us, the game'll never drain us
Cause we gon' stop your shine
And it remains us
It's all good, you taking everything sweet
But it's the problems and the pressure that they can't see
I'm trying to make a quick flip
Nigga can you dig this?
Shit is real, make a mil forever be that rich bitch

[Chorus]
Where my niggas at? (what)

Uh, yo

And let some clown take my shine like i ain't working overtime
I refuse to fuck up, and lose my place i got in line, huh
Bitch please
Erased your name with ease
And it was nothing, caught you stunting got no room to breathe
Only into big things
All day spit game
Trying to put my people up on paper before shit change

Trying to get my papes right
After every show, i gotta go, i got a late flight
Thought they had us figure out
Cause we pulling figures out
Not that bitch, who is she and what's that nigga swizz about?
Questions start to come about
Thought my time was running out
But never cause i'm better under pressure, guess you figured out
Stop all the dumb shit
I came to run shit
Think i'm leaving, not at all i'm having to much fun shit

[Chorus]

Uh, yo
Y'all niggas must be bugging out
The industry we dug it out
We always keep it gangsta we change what y'all be talkin' bout
Some get away with bullshit
But they the ones who drown quick
Back on the block, hustling, scraping money up to buy a brick
Too late, cause it's over now
I done shut this whole shit down
Yeah it's me again, you outta touch bitch, fix your frown
C'mon! c'mon! uh! uh! what! what! c'mon!
Bounce [Repeats]

[Chorus]

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Eve's that girl
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Can I turn you on by my word's spell?
Look into my eyes think I want you, can't tell
Me I keep it sexy, daddy so I can't fail
Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist now cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the do-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that?
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed game game around me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't messin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch check what I've been through
Got mine took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dog I ownin' dot coms

[Chorus]

Yo, yo I can understand why you're scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me
Huh, mad cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listening to other shit?
You go the best here
Come on try your luck shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin' vouch for my behavior,
Same way they get down I get down for this paper
Sixteen lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line my world, my way any questions

[Chorus]

Uh, yo power moves is made everyday by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank anyway that I do this shit
I was born to shine while most of y'all was borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want from me, you cats is clueless,
Dispose the flow through my hands like water
Heat starts growing from my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
All ball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch swallow it up while I shut it down
Make em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookign sad at me, I ain't the blame
Back to plan be	 baby I can feel your pain

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Uh, What, Uh, My Baby,

[DMX]
Time to hit y'all cats with another joint from Eve and
the dog
And you know how we do baby creep in the fog
Now hold it down for the fellas, hold it down for the
girls
Keep motherfuckers knowing this rap shit is our world
(What!)
Been there and done that, had fun where the run
at
Don't got to shoot a motherfucker no more so put the
gun back
Pay niggas to do that, cause they a lot better at it
Keep the burner in the truck cause well you got to
have it (aight)
It's an unwritten law (uh huh)
Let a fagot open that unwritten door (uh huh)
Hit 'em with four  hairline to the jaw (what!)
That's what I'm aiming at
We going to get that nigga X aight well keep saying
that
Eve I wish you the best and I'll always love you
(what)
Never hear me say FUCK YOU because I love you (what)
Always here for you when somebody else is not
A dog and his bitch blowing up the spot
Come on


[Eve]
It should be against the law, me and the dog like a
brawl
And the only thing that can help you is God and you
should call on him
Weak sight, the streets like, creep like
Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
It ain't strange you cats know the name
Double are bubble hard it's a shame
Realest niggas doing it, them clowns they ruin it
Shut 'em down give 'em pounds cause palms go glue in it
Sticky finger niggas steal each other's style
Claiming how they started things not original
Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
If that's the case you should be considered a fan
I'm like tired of the same beats that claim streets
Doing nothing but ducking from the hood got the same
speech
Only one you feeling is you niggas know the deal
Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga


[DMX]
Since the beginning we both knew we was winning
Cause we been in all type of shit  but kept on
spitting, hitting
Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it
was the truth
So they feel that cause it's real black (WHAT!)
We never going to stop, no matter what they say

No matter what they do  they'll never take it away
(Come On)
What the Lord give you let no man curse
E-V-E and DMX from the birth to the earth

[Eve]
Why they sick cause we still close thought that it was over
Cats trying to tear us apart dogs got closer
All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
For real niggas scared us, steady catching thembluffing
What you say shut up nigga saying much of nothing
Act like they don't want it but they demand it
Double are keep it hard and niggas can't stand it





[Drag-On]
I be the D-are-A-G dash ya niggas foot slim
Cause bullets make your feet fast
We throw babies in the trash
Drag don't play with little gats
Crib like McDonald's nothing but Big Macs
And quarter pounds
Bitch place your order now stay in line
I only fuck with broke niggas
That straight depend on crime
You straight pussy so fuck your ass cap
Cause in jail they'll put your cap where
Your ass at you ass black
Projects that's where Drag at
Yea ya got heart
But if I don't got my gun
That's where ya gonna get stabbed at
Boy as a young I never grabbed that toy
Drag was taught to grab that and ask
"Where the cash at"

[Sheek]
You think we shoot his pocket sides
Deuce deuce and 25's
You ain't takin' em' nigga
You threatenin' lives
I ain't frontin motherfucker
I don't shoot no legs
I'm tryin' to see if your brains
Really look like eggs
Or is it just that commercial
Your brain on drugs
Now it's a total different look
From these shotgun slugs
To get rich it could take less than two days
I'm like them little beepers
Half's and bullets two-ways
Fuck vests my shit go through toupees
I'ma thug in New York
And when I'm on your set
We the apartment where they filmed
Good times at
Bitch what the fuck I'ma thug nigga

I'ma thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fucking with me I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing
Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thing

[Styles]
Weight on my back
Hate in my heart
Blood in my eye
Foot on the gas
Blunt in my mouth
Loving the ride
Hand on the gun
Ear to the street
Back to the wall
Mind on my money while I'm clapping at y'all

[Jadakiss]
I got niggas in jail
Crack in the hood
Hustle in south
Fiends and customers
That run in your house
I got family ties
I'm handy with knives
I live my life in the ghetto
Nose candy and nines
I'm deeper than most
Sleep wit it close
Wake wit a demon
Have visions of the whole
World shaking and screaming

[Styles]
I was born to be a leader
But if the game was dirty
I was born to be a cheater
You talking to me greasy
I was going to get the heater

[Jadakiss]
You tell me what you know about blow
Getting dough and straight warrin' with a meaner
Fronting in a Benz or I was soarin' in a Bima

[Styles]
Lyin in the cut
The gun is straight running
Like a tire on the trucks
If he is real or a liar
Put the player to his nuts
Or the fire to his guts

[Jadakiss]
Cause niggas is too soft
That heat make niggas cool off
Fuck ice I'm tryin' to cop the crew lofts

[Styles]
So we can be back in effect
I throw the barrel to the back of your neck
And hop back in the vette (corvette)

[Jadakiss]
Cause everybody is a felon with loot
Cause they say rap is like dust

[Styles and Jadakiss]
And we the only ones sellin' the juice


[Eve]

[Damien Marley]
Mack to wrist to my girl I love the best
But when you left me it's like a bullet to my chest
Now I got to say I got a bullet through vest
Knocked off my feet I pleaded no contest
Sleepless nights without no sleep or rest
This is like a muffin jury you got to mix
Take it no more and had to make her confess
Sometimes I feel I'm in the Wild, Wild West
Lost the love I had now I live to the death

[Stephen Marley (Damien Marley)]
Long as I she caught me lying I get caught for lying
If she sure believe then sure believe is the sign
But listening to promises what a fool am I
Can somebody tell me? You know all his life
I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losing my mind
The news that your moving got me standing outside
Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine
Mrs. Lovely Vessel body all mine
Girl went to shoot me with the shoot all mind
Sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
Cause there's no where to go since you left me behind
(Now it's true, true) that I loved you for truth
(true, true) she stick like ankle glue
(true, true) I make your gray skies blue
(true, true) you want me pers-nal boo
Chilling up on the house our love be that strong
DJ's steady playing on the one's and two's





First time I seen your face I was like damn
Put your arm around my waist I was like man
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man
True I'm human like you but gotta play it smart
Questions I gotta ask for we get this start
Pulse racing fast damn can you feel my heart
Got me feeling wild yeah you doing your player part
Trying to feel you up excuse me I mean feel you out
What your life like tell me what your mind about
Oh you ain't even tryin' to share no secrets straight to bis
Wifey, baby mother, you got any kids
One word answers oh I ain't feeling that
Then the pain for american express black
But I'm a play it cool and let you think you running things
You seem official long as you ain't runnin names

You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touching on me (you know you want it)
But I got go

Listen baby you know that I'm attracted to you crazy
But I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me
You ain't really telling me shit and tryin' slay me
And on the real this quiet shit is starting to drive me crazy
The only thing that's keeping me still is sex appeal
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real
Something in my mind saying that you probably got the skills
But I ain't giving in your friends they feminine
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimming in
But them lips though make me wanna try my luck
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck
Cause you dress right I'm supposed to be pressed right
But on the real you got me thinking if I could be blessed tonight
Let me stop thinking these things it's not polite
I wanna give it to you raw but I'ma put up a fight


From subliminal seduction not really touching
But like rubbing acting like you wanting nothing
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushing
Treat me like your pray only your sexual hunting
I'm running fronting cause really I'm wanting to
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushing
I'm tight vexed cause I'm really dwelling on the sex
Chills up my spine the way you smelling up my neck
I'm like putty in your hands I gotta keep my composure
Plus I'm tryin' to remember how long I really known ya
You make it hard fighting you off is like a job
But I'm doing good so far body starting to throb
Should I give in ready to open my garage
And let you park in the dark but damn I gotta
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave
You need know that dinner was lovely but I really gotta go

[Eve]
This song is a dedication to those strugglin' and livin' on
For those who can't see the light, it's comin'
Stay strong, feel me

[Teena Marie]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah,

Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

[Eve]
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year

Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me

No doubt I struggle, I cry at times
Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down

Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me

Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me
And it's funny, 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life, or they want my money

[Chorus]

[Teena Marie]
How can life be so hard?
How can my life be so hard?
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Every day I pray to God
Every day I pray
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Eve]
Been through a lot
Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Close is to do you dirty just so they can take your spot
Some days I feel like I want to quit

But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin tricks
Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind

I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes

Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin,' claimin' realness but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely

I feel like people see me really don't know me
But my best friend is Him, and I know He'll hold me

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I got a lot of people on my side protectin' me
Dee, Waah, Chivon, and the family
Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right

I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him, for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans; I love the way they love me

Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin, livin lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lot of people think I'm lucky, travelin and hangin out

But if they only knew, I +WISH+ I could be hangin out
I'm bangin out hits, in the studio I'm livin low
Makin plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin dough
Huh, come on, just so the people know
Uhh, come on, just so the people know





I'm just trying to be me, to be me!
One
Cause I really want to see the world
Two
Always knew I was a super girl
Three
Stay laced in diamonds and Pearls,that's the way you gotta treat a girl

When I was broke
Cats was like do that
Now that I got something
Cats is like screw that
They wish that I would've blew that
Back with them complaining
Spassing, Stressed out not maintaining
I move on
Speak shit, So forth and so on
You the one that made me go forth and blow on
Blew up called me cherry bond
Change my hair from blonde
Mad, because I don't go and investigate the hole Gucci line
Let me live niggas
Did this with my own rhymes
Because publishing a mother fucker baby
And I own mine
Work hard I deserve the best in life
She stay clean I deserve to be dressed up right?
She spits mean God definitely blessed her right?
We can all buy diamonds and furs
Nothing can tell
We can all buy the bar but we all can sell
Your careers yea more change your style wear a veal


Mad cause we got shit
Drop what I drop shit
Mad cause we killing it
All we do is drop hits
Long cash 21 investing to stop shit
Calling bragging way to long so I can cop shit
So now I'm suppose to down play
All the things I want in life
Got my own money now
Ain't gotta be nobody wife
Only if I want too
Not cause I need too
Choose the situations
I do and what I go through
I told you I was gonna make it big ,onna grow
This is dedicated to all the haters who don't know
But they knew what it was haters created my buzz
Talking bout me!
Made people wonder who she was?
And I'm here now
Going on my 2nd year now
Fuck it
We can take it there
Keep it at a stare down
Now I think that my message is clear now
That bitch,
E-V-E Sing it what ya hear now


Traveling to me away
Was Atlantic City now
Float me on a boat in the Atlantic feel me?
Gotta come to the table with something
Cause I got mine
Gotta spoil eve royally
Not just lay pipe lines
Saying I ain't your type line
That just means you Jelly
I said it before I can feel my own belly
Need you for what?
Yea get in where you fit
If you can I'm gonna keep it comfortable
That's my plan
Understand?
I'm just trying to be me
Bubbling Phila bitch
Course I'ma Boss and Floss

From chips to whip
Keys to her own crib
Big shit to grip
I'm living it now
Soldiers simmer it down

Too oh I remember her now!
Niggas couldn't stand her
Now they want to give her a pound
Want to know her
Cause now my feet is planted in the ground

And I'm just so ferocious to the rhythm of a high hat

Do what the fuck I wanna do 'til I die

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
Now fights between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam, pow, pow
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?

Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave those kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

"Wrong, do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
"You! Yes, you behind the bike sheds, stand still laddy!"

Overhead the albatross
Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
An echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one called us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
Something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb toward the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand
The best I can

And no one called us to the land
And no one crosses there alive
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Almost everyday you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me
To rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabys
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

Hopelessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out,
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise!

A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul

He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones,

Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

Would this do
To make it all right
While sleep has taken you
Where I'm out of sight

[Chorus]
I'll make my getaway
Time on my own
Search for a better way
To find my way home
To your smile

Wasting days and days
On this night
Always down and up
Half the night

Hopeless to reminisce
Through the dark hours
We'll only sacrifice
What time will allow us
You're sighing, sighing

All alone
Though you're right here
Now it's time to go
From your sad stare

[Chorus]

Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on  now
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship  smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.

O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more, ah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black
I've had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why. I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a room full of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front, it's red and black

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a room full of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink, a, drink, a, drink, a, drink

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away, away, away, away, away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do, I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away, away, away, away, away

Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be, a, be, a, be, a, be, a, be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.

Home
Home again
I like to be here
When I can

When I come home
Cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones
Beside the fire

Far away
Across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave those kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

"Wrong, do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
"You! Yes, you behind the bike sheds, stand still laddy!"

You! Yes, you! Stand still laddy

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives

Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on  now
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship  smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.

O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more, ah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, don't leave me
Walk around and choose your own ground

Long you live and high you fly
Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
All you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one

For long you'll live, and high you'll fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.
I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why. I call him Gerald.
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.

Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
All that you give
All that you deal
All that you buy
Beg, borrow or steal
All you create
All you destroy
All that you do
All that you say
All that you eat
And everyone you meet
All that you slight
And everyone you fight
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
And the thing that I'm beginning to know of
Let it go
I'll be there when you call
And whenever I fall at your feet
Do let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
Words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Go now
I'll be there when you call
And whenever I fall at your feet
Do let your tears rain down on me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help
Who knows where that might lead
I fall

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help
Who knows where that might lead
I fall at your feet

I have seen peace. I have seen pain,
Resting on the shoulders of your name.
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

I have seen birth. I have seen death.
Lived to see a lover's final breath.
Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?
And if you want to talk about it once again,
On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder.
You're a friend.

You and I have been through many things.
I'll hold on to your heart.
I wouldn't cry for anything,
But don't go tearing your life apart.

I have seen fear. I have seen faith.
Seen the look of anger on your face.
And if you want to talk about what will be,
Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

Annie, you had your name in the bright lights
I thought I saw your photograph
having such a laugh, in a magazine
Did it all come tumbling?

Then Annie, you were made for the big time
They said you were a star to be
In the NME
But the walls came tumbling down
Down
Will you go down on me?

Cause Annie you're a star
You're just not going very far
And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

Annie, would it be nice to be recognized?
Did you practice your autograph?
But now no ones asked
And it's such a shame
Your dreams are crumbling

Annie, why aren't you big in limelight?
Cause I thought that you said you'd be
A celebrity several years ago
But it all came tumbling down
Down
Will you go down on me?

Cause Annie you're a star
You're just not going very far
And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

Is it an evil sign?

Is it a man resigned?

Leaving you behind?
Is it ever gonna stop
Will they ever let you go
Your in a rush they don't care enough
Cause there lives are very slow
Time is ticking on

And when you sell your soul
For a leading role will the lost souls be forgot

And now your body's drained?

They will never let you go.
You're in a rush.

I really want you
I really want you

Many Prophets preach on bended knees
Many clerics wasted wine,
Do the bloody sheets and those troubled streets mean?
I have wasted time,

Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy untold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know so hard for you to do that (really want you)
Time's running out as it often does
And often dictates that you can't do that (really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you
I really want you

Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or when mother earth complained
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain

They say a million people bow and scream
To an effigy of gold
As so life begin
And the ship we're in
And history unfold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know so hard for you to do that (really want you)
Time's running out as it often does
And often dictates that you can't do that (really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you

So while I'm turning in my sheets
And once again I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go

Hello, hello

There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but
My heart is heavy does it show
I lose the track that loses me
So here I go

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

And so I sent some men to fight
And one came back at dead of night
Said he'd seen my enemy
Said he looked just like me
So I set out to cut myself
And here I go

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

And maybe someday we will face
And maybe talk but not just speak
Don't buy the promises 'Cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Uhuh uhuh uhuh

Uhuh uhuh uhuh
So while I'm turning in my sheets
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
And once again I cannot sleep
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Walk out the door and up the street
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Look at the stars
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Look at the stars falling down
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
And I wonder where
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
Did I go wrong?

Are you calling for our last dance?
I see it in your eyes ... in your eyes
I could use the same old lines ... but I'll sing

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out,
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I, just shone, just shone

And when silence greets my last goodbye
The words I need are in your eyes
And I'll sing

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I just shone, just shone

So shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out,
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I just shone, just shone

I have seen peace. I have seen pain,
Resting on the shoulders of your name.
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

I have seen birth. I have seen death.
Lived to see a lover's final breath.
Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?
And if you want to talk about it once again,
On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder.
You're a friend.

You and I have been through many things.
I'll hold on to your heart.
I wouldn't cry for anything,
But don't go tearing your life apart.

I have seen fear. I have seen faith.
Seen the look of anger on your face.
And if you want to talk about what will be,
Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

How I wish I could surrender my soul;
Shed the clothes that become my skin;
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
Far, far away; find comfort in pain.




I just can't believe that it's over.
We were chilling out on the sofa,
Digging how the guitar goes,
In a song that no one knows.
Did you lick that line yourself,
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Do you seem real but I seem fake?
Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?

[Chorus]
So long, Jimmy, so long.
Though you only stayed a moment,
We all know that you're the one. Singing,
So long, Jimmy, so long.
Sure we're glad for the experience,
We miss you now you've gone.
We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,
We all wish we wrote this song.
Life goes on.

I'm just so relieved that it's over.
We were hanging out going nowhere,
Digging how the guitar goes,
In a song that no one knows.
Did you burn that bridge yourself,
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Are you just cool and I'm just baked?
Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?

[Chorus]

She said to me, "Go steady on me
Won't you tell me what the wise men said?
When they came down from Heaven
Smoked nine until seven
All the shit that they could find
But they couldn't escape from you
Couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just trying to have some fun"

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Really sorry now
They weren't to know
They got caught up in your talent show
With you pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress
Who just judge each other and try to impress
But they couldn't escape from you
Couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just trying to have some fun

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Got to ask youself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask youself the question
Where are you now?

I just can't believe that it's over

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care

You touched my heart you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer but when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow

How I wish I could surrender my soul,
Shed the clothes that become my skin,
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind,
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
Far, far away, find comfort in pain.
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.

Ava Adele, I already can tell
You are the one for me
Well, it hasn't been long
But I'm already way gone
In the eyes, Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele

And I searched low and high
Never did find one thing worth dyin' for
But I'd fall to the ground
I'd go all the way down
Fightin', Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele
Yeah, my search is through, I say this to you
I love you, Ava Adele

I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, married now

I heard, that you're dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you

You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go?

I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts

Hold me closer, one more time,
Say that you love me in your last goodbye,
Please forgive me, for my sins,
Yes, I swam dirty waters,
But you pushed me in,
I've seen your face, under every sky,
Over every border and on every line,
You know my heart, more than I do,
We were the greatest, me and you,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Let me stay here for just one more night,
Build your world around me,
And pull me to the light,
So I can tell you that I was wrong,
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
I know I left you speechless

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better for you,

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and  a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more

Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free,
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again?

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning oh

She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh

But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for

When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I will never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
And I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you

Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

We all want some one to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been, where we've been

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the snigger
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia

Everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

There's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you

Just because we're having a say so
And not lining up to be play doh
In five years time will it be
Who the fuck's arctic monkeys'

'Cause everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

All the thoughts that I just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue

It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape'

Lady where's your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
?No chance, you'll get nothing from me?
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
And he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Lady where's your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing
And now realizing it won't change a thing
Realizing it won't change a thing

The requested track is not viewable.

Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
Her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

A country home, even if we really tried
Would it cease to surprise us now
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back d'ya know?

Well, I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well, spoken girls and stilettos
Aren't something to fear

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

Cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
As well as you think
And you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

Oh there ain't no love no, Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes 'n' DJ sets 'n'
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
There's a super cool band yeah
With their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
I don't want to hear your

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at the back
All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
Oh she's running to the streets outside
"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band were fucking wank
And I'm not having a nice time"

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)

Yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far
Yeah I'm sure it's pretty far

And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook

Now then Mardy Bum
I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bare

Can't we laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Yeah I'm sorry I was late
Well I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs ,oh when you say I don't care
Well of course I do, yeah I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Still it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Don't you always do the same
It's what you there for, don't you know

The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best ...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Well don't you always do the same
It's what you're there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak

And I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit frank spencer?
I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks

Never again
Never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces

Oh, spending all of your money
On trendy haircuts that you think look cool
And you're probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Oh ya know it for a fact
That everybody's eating outta your hand
What do you know?
Oh you know nothing!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
What do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing!

Fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up, and you don't look the same
I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah I'm surprised you hadn't forgotten my name
But you know it
Yeah you knew it all along
Oh you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbin', oh don't tell me I'm wrong

What do you know?
Oh you know nothing!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
What do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing, no!

Whoa

Yeah, so what do you know?
Oh you know nothing, no!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
Yes, so what do you know?
Oh you know nothing, no!

You sold your soul to the fashion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
Where's the love and the passion?
Oh I suppose that's nothing to do with you
But it's alright, put it all on one-side
And everybody's looking
You got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine

So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got chased last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they won't catch me and you

Have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
I'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in a riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

Ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
You're coming up our end aren't you
I'll get one with you
He wouldn't let us have six in
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no though
He didn't have to be rude

See her with the green dress
She talked to me at the bar
How come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Couldn't you see she were gorgeous
She were beyond belief
There was this lad at her side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Can I buy you a tropical reef?

Sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said it's High Green mate
Via Hillsborough please

Well how funny were that sketch earlier
Up at that taxi rank
Oh no you woulda missed it,
It were when you went to the bank
These two lads went round proper shouting
About who was next in the queue
The kind of thing that would seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
You're acting like a silly little boy
And they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
(They said) no surrender
No chance of retreat

And so why are we in a taxi?
Because I didn't want to leave
I said It's High Green Mate
Via Hillsborough please

Drunken plot's hatched to jump it
Ask around are you sure?
Went for it but the red light was showing
And the red light indicates doors are secured

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan, has he got one
You better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true
I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do
And I never will

Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we got in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said
I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you?
You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires

Last night these two bouncers
And one of em's alright
The other one's the scary one
His way or no way, totalitarian

He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he don't want you to

So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's now you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?

He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want, arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
This town's a different town today
This town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

That girl's a different girl today
Said that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

And over there, there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell em if you like
We'll tell em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

I said no
Oh no
Oh you won't get me to go
Anywhere, said anywhere
I won't go
Oh no no

Well over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And yeah they might overstep the line
But I just cannot get angry in the same way
Not in the same way
Not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no

Despair to the point will they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
The sheer desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

Despair to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top one hundred list

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

She saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says 'we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around

When did your list replace the twist and turn
Ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Assuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?

He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

D is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
Three quarters of an hour ago
That led him to be in a position
And every copper mission
On every other episode

He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

You knew in five minutes
But I knew in a sentence
You knew in five minutes
But I knew in a sentence

So why do we go through all of this again?
Your eyes are flutterin'
Such pretty wings.
A moth, flyin' into the
Same old flame again
It never ends

It's not like I dropped the bomb,
On my conscience mom
It takes fightin' day and night
To make such a good thing die

Out, everyone out
I give too much shit at home
In my heart and mind
It gets me every time, it gets me every time, it gets me every time

So why do we go
Through all this shit again
Your eyes are flutterin'
Such pretty wings.
A moth flyin' into me
The same old flame again
It never ends, it never ends, it never ends, it never ends

She's gone to sea
She's fightin' for me
What bravery!

I'm sleeping in a battle ship
I'm sleeping in a submarine
I'm sleeping in a fighter plane
I'm sleeping going down the drain

All hands on deck!

The radio adresss
What a mess!

A cage is a cage
Is a cage, is a cage!

We know a place where no planes go
We know a place where no ships go

(Hey!) No cars go
(Hey!) No cars go
Where we know

We know a place no space ships go
We know a place where no subs go

(Hey!) No cars go
(Hey!) No cars go
Where we know

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Cars go!)

(Hey!) Us kids know
(Hey!) No cars go
Where we know

Between the click of the light and the start of the dream

I don't want any pushing, and I don't want any shoving.
We're gonna do this in an orderly manner.
Women and children!
Women and children!
Women and children, let's go!
Old folks, let's go!
Babies needing cribs, let's go!

I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is on to us
Let's join the little babes
Throwin' rocks in front of us

Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road before our parents send for us

Trees keep fallin' at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float?
What I said was not a joke,
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope

Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!

I'll admit I'm full of shit
That's how I know I love you
That's how I know I trust you,
You're not sure if there's a right or wrong
But it feels like there is when I treat you like this
I go outside
I go outside

Texas, I won't come home
Not even if you call
I can't hear you at all
I can't explain why it's a sin the state I'm living in
I just feel so tired
I go outside
I go outside

My mouth is full, your heart is an apple
My mouth is full, my heart is an apple
Pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme

Please don't even call
I can't hear you at all.

The red lights mean you're leaving
The white one's mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning

The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold

The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms

All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world,
Types of world,
Tears of world

You wanna be set apart? Burn all of your art repair the wasteful part
I'm a vampire in a forest fire
Hey! we all gotta keep warm
Hey we all gotta keep warm, driving towards the storm

Your father was a pervert
Face down in the dirt
He taught you how to hurt
My father was a miner who lived in the suburbs
Let's live in the suburbs
If I let where I'm from burn I can never return!

My brother reads you and me his new poetry
How embarrassing
Your sister pours the gasoline
I'll fix your meals
I'll fix your meals, while your burns heal!

Find a house you don't have to rebuild
Stone by stone, brick by brick, nail by nail my father never meant to leave me this
Let this love last
I drive too fast
Said I'd return if I'd ever cared
But there's no interstate I find to take me there

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And I can fall asleep

My family tree's
Losing all it's leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat
To melt the street beneath your feet

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning how

Somethin' filled up
My heart with nothin',
Someone told me not to cry.

Now that I'm older,
My heart's colder,
And I can see that it's a lie.

Children wake up,
Hold your mistake up,
Before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children don't grow up,
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
We're just a million little god's causin' rain storms turnin' every good thing to rust.
I guess we'll just have to adjust.

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin' to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin'
With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am go-goin'

You better look down below.

Sleeping is giving in,
No matter what the time is.
Sleeping is giving
In, so lift those heavy eyelids.
People say that you'll die faster than without water.
But we know it's just a lie,
Scare your son and scare your daughter.
People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya.
Come on baby in our dreams,
We can live our misbehavior.
Every time you close your eyes lies, lies!
People try and hide the night underneath the covers.
People try and hide the light underneath the covers.

Come on hide your lovers
Underneath the covers.
Come on hide your lovers
Underneath the covers.
Hidin' from your brothers underneath the covers,
Come on hide your lovers underneath the covers.
People say that you'll die faster than without water,
But we know it's just a lie, scare your son, scare your daughter
Now here's the sun, it's alright!
Now here's the moon, it's alright!
Now here's the sun, it's alright!
Now here's the moon, it's alright!
But every time you close your eyes, lies!

And if the snow buries my, my neighborhood.
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours,
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours.

You climb out the chimney,
And meet me in the middle, the middle of the town.
And since there's no one else around,
We let our hair grow long,
And forget all we used to know.
Then our skin gets thicker from
Living out in the snow.

You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head,
As the day grows dim
I hear you sing a golden hymn

Then we tried to name our babies
But we forgot all the names that
The names we used to know.
But sometimes, we remember our bedrooms,
And our parents' bedrooms,
And the bedrooms of our friends.
Then we think of our parents,
Well what ever happened to them?!

You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head to gold,
As the day grows dim,
I hear you sing a golden hymn,
The song I've been trying to say.

Purify the colors, purify my mind.
Purify the colors, purify my mind,
And spread the ashes of the colors,
Over this heart of mine!

I woke up with the power out,
Not really something to shout about.
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are swingin' from the power lines,
Nobody's home, so nobody minds.

I woke up on the darkest night,
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light.
(We found the light)
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small.

I went out into the night.
I went out to pick a fight with anyone.
Light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.
Growin' up in some strange storm,
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are dyin' out in the snow,
Look at them go, look at them go!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.

What's the plan?

Is it a dream? Is it a lie?
I think I'll let you decide.
Just light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Cause nothin's hid, from us kids!
You ain't foolin' nobody with the lights out!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.
And there's something wrong in the heart of man,
You take it from your heart and put it in your hand!

Where'd you go?

I am waitin' 'til I don't know when,
Cause I'm sure it's gonna happen then.
Time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood,
Killing old folks, wakin' up babies
Just like we knew it would.

All the neighbors are startin' up a fire,
Burning all the old folks the witches and the liars.
My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids,
But my heart keeps watchin'
Through the skin of my eyelids.

They say a watched pot won't ever boil,
Well I closed my eyes and nothin' changed,
Just some water getting hotter in the flames.

It's not a lover I want no more,
And it's not heaven I'm pining for,
But there's some spirit I used to know,
That's been drowned out by the radio!

They say a watched pot won't ever boil,
You can't raise a baby on motor oil,
Just like a seed down in the soil
You gotta give it time.

They say it fades if you let it,
Love was made to forget it.
I carved your name across my eyelids,
You pray for rain I pray for blindness.

If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom.

The only thing that you keep changin'
Is your name, my love keeps growin'
Still the same, just like a cancer,
And you won't give me a straight answer!

If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me.

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom.

The pains of love, and they keep growin',
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love,
Since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love is not upon me
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Cause this crown is not within me.
It's not within me, it's not within me.

You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say

You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word,
The only word that I can say!

Somethin' filled up
My heart with nothin',
Someone told me not to cry.

Now that I'm older,
My heart's colder,

Well now you may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts
Well honey it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasure
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

How pink volcano in the heard of the torndao
Is shaking the lemonade tree
Hot pink forest is backed by a furnace
That boils the lemonade free

And it all went down
And it all went down
Tomorrow is a number

Hot pink apple with the sweet golden dimple
Has stuck it's claim in me
Hot pink rubber it comes in every color
And every style you please

And it all went down
And it all went down
Tomorrow is a number

Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me
That I sometimes cry
If I could pretend that I'm asleep
When my tears start to fall
I peek out from behind these walls
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows, no

Nobody likes,
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice
The one I used to hear before my life
Made a choice
But I think nobody knows
No, no
Nobody knows
No

Baby
Oh, the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And, baby, don't it feel like I'm all alone?
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home?

I think nobody knows, no
I said nobody knows
Nobody cares

It's win or lose, not how you play the game
And the road to darkness has a way
Of always knowing my name
But I think nobody knows
No, no
Nobody knows, no, no, no, no

Baby
Oh, the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And, baby, don't it feel like I'm all alone?
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home?

And, oh, no, no, no, no
Nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, no

Tomorrow I'll be there, my friend
I'll wake up and start all over again
When everybody else is gone
No, no, no

Nobody knows
Nobody knows the rhythm of my heart
The way I do when I'm lying in the dark
And the world is asleep
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me
Me

Dear Mr. President I
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's all these cracks
Crack of sunlight
Crack in the mirror, on your lips
It's the moment of a sunset, Friday
When our conversations twist
It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo
But the ice should be on our heads
We only spun a web to catch ourselves
So we weren't left for death

And I was never looking for approval from anyone but you
And though this journey is over, I'll go back if you ask me to

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink of your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight

You can do the math a thousand ways, but you can't erase the facts
That others come, and others go, but you always come back
I'm a winter flower underground, always thirsty for summer rain
And just like the change of seasons
I know you'll be back again

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink of your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight

I'm not dead just yet
I'm not dead, I'm just floating
Doesn't matter where I'm going
I'll find you
I'm not scared at all
Underneath the cuts and bruises
Finally gained what no one loses
I'll find you
I will find you

I'm not dead, just floating
I'm not scared, just changing
You're my crack of sunlight, yeah

Ha ha ha
We're gonna rock and roll
Ra, ra
All right, I drink more than you
I party harder than you do
And my car's faster than yours too

P, I, N, K
P, I, M, P
I'm back again
I know y'all missed me
I'm so so sick
Can't handle it
Yeah, I talk shit
Just deal with it

My rims are twenty-three inch
And they're black on black
No, they're not his
Diamonds all over my teeths (her teeth)
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

You know I'm rare
You stop and stare
You think I care
I don't
You talk real loud
But you ain't saying nothing cool
I could fit your whole house in my swimming pool

My life's a fantasy
That you're not smart enough to even dream
My ice is making me freeze
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

Uh
Break it down
It's tough times out here; ya know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm super thick
People say I'm much too chic
Come and kiss the ring
You just might learn a couple things
I'm trying to school you, dog
Roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof
I'm your worst nightmare
Bring it, we can take it there
What, are you scared?

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cause I can

Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
I love you so
Much more when you're not here
Watchin' all the bad shows
Drinking all of my beer

I don't believe Adam and Eve
Spent every goddamn day together
If you give me some room, there will be room enough for two

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

I don't wanna wake up with another
But I don't wanna always wake up with you either
No, you can't hop into my shower
All I ask for is one fuckin' hour
You taste so sweet
But I can't eat the same thing every day
Cuttin' off the phone
Leave me the fuck alone
Tomorrow I'll be beggin' you to come home

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

Go away
Come back
Go away
Come back
Why can't I just have it both ways?
Go away
Come back
Go away
Come back
I wish you knew the difference
Go away
Come back

Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

Tonight
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight

Tonight
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
I'm tired
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Leave me alone; I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you
Tonight
Go away
Give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye
It'll make me want to kiss you, kiss you

Check it out, goin' out on the late night
Lookin' tight, feeling nice; it's a cock fight
I can tell I just know that it's going down, tonight
At the door, we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar, six shots just beginnin'
That's when dick head put his hands on me
But ya see

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself, guess you're out of luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
Buh-bye
Listen up, it's just not happenin'
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight, a'ight

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

You're in the corner with your boys; you bet them five bucks
You'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me

You know you are
High five and talking shit
But you are going home alone
Aren't ya?

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over, before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates,
They'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,

Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words,
This is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause You and I
We were born to die
We were born to die

My old man is a bad man, but I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have an LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you sittin', sippin' on your black Cristal, yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town 'cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again on Rikers Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy baby, I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man, but he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me, admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

He likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Tell me you own me, give me them coins

I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

You open up a beer
And you come over here
And play a video game

I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

(Now you do)

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

Life is awesome, I confess

You got nothing, I got tested
And I'm best, yes
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

Go, baby, go (Go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show (Go, go, go, go, go)

I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me is a fucking bore to me
But babe

Tell me songs at night about your favorite girl

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime
Drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

Zoomin' my miles in gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go ski it
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime
Drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo

People never die in Miami, that's what they all say

White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Dance the night away

You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?

You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
No what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

The sun also rises on those who fail to call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Dope and diamonds

I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown,
Because you like your women Spanish, dark, strong and proud.
I paint the sky black,
You said if you could have your way,
You'd make a night time what a day,
So it suits the mood of your soul
Ohhh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

Ohhhhh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue,
They're magnificent,
It don't make sense to you

Black beauty
Ohhh oh oh
Black beauty
Ohhh oh

I paint the house black,
My wedding dress black leather, too.
You have no room for light,
Love is lost on you.
I keep my lips red,
They seem like cherries in the spring.
Darling, you can't let everything seem so dark blue.

But, ohhh
What can I do,
To turn you on,
Or get through you?

Ohhh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
But you don't have a clue.
Sun and ocean blue,
They're magnificent,
It don't make sense to you.

Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh

Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black bea-u-uty,
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Black beauty baby
Black beauty baby

Ohhhh what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue,
They're magnificent,
It don't make sense to you

Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh
Black beauty,
Ohhhh

The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair, anywhere.

The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone
Alone

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been?
Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh

And if you call I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come
Oh-oh oh, ah-ah ah

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty

All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

I'll wait for you, babe, that's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe, you never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got my drugs and that
Like my memories, I don't need that

I'll wait for you, babe, you don't come through, babe
You never do, babe, that's just what you do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Don't say you need me when
You're leaving, you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me then
You leave last, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it best

I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Being a mistress on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
We've been around on the side
Wanna be something you would do

But you haven't seen my man

You haven't seen him

He's got the fire and he walks with fame

Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on

To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail

Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train

The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line

I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way you're heading me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could handover the keys oh

I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map

So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and got no regret
My co-pilot yeah that's right
Now I can just enjoy the ride

I'll let you lead the way now

He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window's eye

He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
Oh, let's ride and ride and ride and ride...

I am a passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backside
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight

I am a passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripped-back sky
And everything looks good tonight

Oh, the passenger
How-how he rides
Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the silent hollow sky
He see the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me

Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? one summer day,
That same night be on your way

Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
Seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were sayin' the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly.
What is a man deep down inside,
What a raging beast with nothing to hide.

Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

Permission now to let this thing land
I'm too far gone to know where I am
Conditions are worse than we planned
Permission now to let this thing land

Heading straight into the blackness
Beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

Adam took the apple, I was not involved
I'm not responsible for how lost we are
Batten down the hatches, extinction calls
But Adam took the apple, I was not involved

Heading straight into the blackness
Way beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

Maybe a rumble
Maybe nothing more
Maybe a thunder
There before she blows
Maybe not a big bang
But just a little white noise

Into the furnace of red twilight
Threading like a needle through searchlights
Fading further and spinning right
Into the furnace of red twilight

Heading straight into the blackness
Too far gone, now there's no turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

I am a passenger

Here I lay
Still and breathless
Just like always
Still, I want some more
Mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind?
Just like always
Still your passenger

The chrome buttons buckle on leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
This time won't you please
Drive faster

Roll the windows down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice cool seats
There to cushion your knees
Now to calm me
Take me around again
Just don't pull over
This time would you please
Drive faster

Roll the windows down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows down
To catch my breath
And then go and go and go just drive me
Home and back again

Here I lay just like always
Don't let me go
Take me to the edge

Caged
Hold so tight until your knuckles show
Escape
As far away as you could ever know

You sink them all down
Watch them float up
'til the wheel has spun around
You will
Be bound by what you are

Stand in the corner, with your face stripped of color
For what?

If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
Step outside and see
Another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

Chained
So many places you'd prefer to be
Than framed
By a picket fence and salary

You sink them all down
Then watch them float up
Until the
Wheel has spun around

You will be bound by who you are
Tied to the corner
With your
Hope twisted under
In knots

If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
Step outside and see another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

'Cause my everything is you
You are my everything
You give me the melody
I sing what you give to me

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you want me to
I'll let you navigate
Just let me ride with you

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you wanna go
If you show me the way
Just lead and I'll follow

Wherever you go I'll follow you
I'll be your passenger
I'll do anything to follow you
Wherever you go
I'll be your passenger, yea yea

I'll close my eyes and I'll trust you
Take me wherever you want me to go
And I'll go there
I'll go there
Even where the eyes can't see
As long as you're with me

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you want me to
I'll let you navigate
Just let me ride with you

I'll be your passenger
I'll go where you wanna go
If you show me the way
Just lead and I'll follow

I've got these letters tattooed on my arm
That remind me each second of where I come from
And the long hard road to get me back home

Back to my mama who raised me up right
And back to my lady, I held every night
It's a long hard road trying to get home

I'd been gone now for too long

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home

I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

I've got this image engraved in my mind
Of a life that I had in a whole different time
It still breathes and lives at the end of the road

I've seen mountains and valleys through my missing days
But I never once parted with how you begged me to stay
I will run down that long hard and treacherous road to get home

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home

I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

I've been gone for so long
But my heart it carries on
As it pounds like a drum
On my journey back home

I've been gone for so long
But my heart it carries on
I won't give up

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home

I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

I'm just trying to get home

How can we make amends when we said all we said?
I call and you don't pick up
How can I say instead that I hope it's for the best?
I won't, and I won't give up

I'm sorry, Mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town

How can we push aside all the bad and make it right
Now you got me all choked up
I'm sorry, brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

How can we both pick sides when we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride and drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrow's filling up my cup

I'm sorry, father
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

Well some birds aren't meant to be caged
And I just can't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

How can I set us free?
I'm what you taught me to be
Shouldn't that be enough?
It's time that we make amends
Let's forget the things we said
You know we were all just stuck

I'm sorry, mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry, father
I didn't stick around
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
Just like my old man, I make my own luck

And some birds aren't meant to be caged
And some just won't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

Oh now you never come around
And then you're spacing out tonight
I bet I feel it in my chest
The visions in your head they're all lies
Oh ya it's true
Oh ya it's true

Well I
I need a friend tonight
I need to make it right
And now I'm tired of thinking
In spite
I'm always in the right
I never made the time
It's all the smiles I'm faking
(Oh oh) Oh yeah it's true

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breaking through
Feels like a dead end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keeping me from you
If I break that you hate that
So take that any way you want to

Inhale
Another thought fails
Falling off the rails
Tonight
Untamed
A c-c-crazy train
I'm always yours to blame
In your eyes
Shake a shake it off now
Then you're take a taking off now
All around so you can shoot me down
I should have gotten out before you started begging
(Oh oh) Oh yeah it's true
(Oh oh) Oh yeah it's true

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breaking through
Feels like a dead end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keeping me from you
If I break that you hate that
So take that any way you want to

(Woah woah)
(Woah woah)
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer
(Woah) If only I could live a little bit longer

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breaking through
Feels like a dead end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keeping me from you
If I break that you hate that
So take that any way you want to

(Woah) Any way any way any way
(Woah) Any way you want to
(Woah) Any way
(Woah) So take that any way you want to

Remember when we were lost at sea?
We would look at the bright night sky
Thinking of, what we could be
What we could be
How to spend our lives

Remember when we had nothing left?
We were strung out in the cold
Holding on, trying to save our breath
Trying to save our breath
We would not let go

(Whoa)
Through the good, through the bad and ugly
(Whoa)
We'll conquer anything

'Cause one day we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
With love, love

Remember down in the forest heart
We were lost, losing hope and faith
We put our trust in counting stars
We were counting stars
Trying to find our way
Remember up on the mountain top
Looking out on the rocks below
Thinking God, we will never stop
We will never stop
No we won't let go

'Cause one day we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
(Love, love)

Like a scene from the past
Where we look back and laugh
With love, love
A thought like a flash
Black and white, hope it lasts
With love, love
Like a scene from the past
Where we look back and laugh
With love, love
A thought like a flash
Black and white, hope it lasts
With love

'Cause one day we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day we'll look at the past
With love, love
(Love, love)
With love, love

How can we make amends when we said all we said?
I call and you don't pick up
How can I say instead that I hope it's for the best?
I won't, and I won't give up

I'm sorry, Mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town

How can we push aside all the bad and make it right
Now you got me all choked up
I'm sorry, brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

How can we both pick sides when we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride and drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrow's filling up my cup

I'm sorry, father
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

Well some birds aren't meant to be caged
And I just can't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

How can I set us free?
I'm what you taught me to be
Shouldn't that be enough?
It's time that we make amends
Let's forget the things we said
You know we were all just stuck

I'm sorry, mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry, father
I didn't stick around
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
Just like my old man, I make my own luck

And some birds aren't meant to be caged
And some just won't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

In the jungle that we roam
To search and find and to explore
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

Pushing back remove the leaves
To find something bigger than me
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it
Hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

If I think too hard and never leave
I'll watch the world turn without me
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

To hide from lions and the wolves
Would never break the fears we hold
All we all we all know
All we all we don't know

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it
Hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good
It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't over think about it
Hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it
Don't over think about it

The requested track is not viewable.

In the morning when the sun breaks free
A reflection I know I've seen
In the night it's haunting me
A lonely ghost, a lonely gho-ost

Ever since I was just a child
I've seen visions in my sleep
Of a man running through the wild
With all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

But you can't breathe in if you don't breathe out

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim, and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts

'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

I'm looking back at a room for two
The skeletons of all we knew
That we were only broke and bruised
As you held me close along the coast

When the morning settles in
And I've learned how to live within
I can't rewind all the things I did
And all these ghosts, the lonely gho-osts

But you can't breathe in if you don't breathe out

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim, and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts

'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

Now we know we'll never be alone, alone
And we know I wanna be alone, alone

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim, and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts

'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Hey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey

A lonely ghost

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

We grow apart just to be on our own
And we walk right next to all that we have known
Give me your hand, we can climb further up
And we climb the trees and the forest seems to be bigger now
Oh we had so much more

I knew she was trouble from the first kiss
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you

We take our time, to see what is up ahead
But we're scared of the past and what is left
We'll stay inside and never let out our hands
And we'll pretend that the world, it will never end
No, it will never end

I knew she was trouble from the first kiss
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you
(One, two, three, four)
I could feel it blowing in the night wind
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you

Why don't you come back down so we can turn it around
Why don't you ever know just to let it go
'Cause nothing comes around for you
So bring me back from one to two
And tell me what else I could do

I knew she was trouble from the first kiss
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you
(One, two, three, four)
I could feel it blowing in the night wind
I could tell that something wasn't right with you, with you

Why don't you come back down so we can turn it around

Don't feel like going home
But all my cash is gone
Yeah, I got nothing to do tonight
I'm passed out on the floor
Up in the hotel bar
But it don't matter, 'cause I'm feeling fine

I'm thinking life's too short, it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

I gave the dice a roll
And then we lost control
You know we're lucky that we survived
'Cause when we jumped the ship
Oh, man, that boat, it flipped
But we should do it all again tonight

I'm thinking life's too short, it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

Giving my body all the things I need
Rescue me with a little whiskey
Staying out, don't need no sleep
I'll sleep when I'm dead, you can bury me
I'll sleep when I'm dead, you can bury me

I guess I'm going home
'Cause all my cash is gone
I spent it all trying to feel alive
Go big or go

(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

It's getting crazy
We're gonna do some things that we won't forget
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
I'm going crazy
I'm gonna live my life, I got no regrets
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

I had a dream so big and loud

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm goin' nowhere

I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No
And I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit angry
When everyone's around
But I get a little lonely
When no one's out

I feel my demons misleading me

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
Weights off my shoulders,
It was bringin' me down (Down)

I've never been that lucky
I've never tasted fame (Fame)
I'm always lookin' for somethin'
But I hate changing

Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinnin' and I won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there

'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

(Na na na na na, nana na na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na, nana na na na na na na na na)

I don't wanna let it go!

Sometimes there's nothing to feel 
Sometimes there's nothing to hold
Sometimes there's no time to run away
Sometimes you just feel so old

The times it hurts when you cry
The times it hurts just to breathe
And then it all seems like there's no-one left
And all you want is to sleep

Fight fight fight
Just push it away
Fight fight fight
Just push until it breaks
Fight fight fight
Don't cry at the pain
Fight fight fight
Or watch yourself burn again
Fight fight fight
Don't howl like a dog
Fight fight
Just fill up the sky
Fight fight fight
Fight til you drop
Fight fight fight
And never never
Never stop

Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight

So when the hurting starts
And when the nightmares begin
Remember you can fill up the sky
You don't have to give in
You don't have to give in

Never give in
Never give in
Never give in

We are almost down to the shore

Peter, Peter on the sea
Drop your nets and follow me
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't turn back
We are almost down to the shore

I said, "Fight on, fight on"
Children don't, don't you turn back
We are almost down to the shore

God told Moses on the mountain top
He said, "Keep on going and don't you stop"
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't, don't you, don't you, don't you turn back
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't turn back
We are almost down to the shore

Moses almost lost his mind
When God said, "Moses, you got to stay behind"
We are almost down to the shore

Walk together by Gods demand
Bound to reach the Promise Land
We are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't, don't you, don't you, don't you turn back
We are, we are almost down to the shore

Fight on, fight on
Children don't turn back
We are all almost down to the shore

Yeah man

Gonna pulp you to a mess of bruises
Cause that's what you're looking for
There's a hole where your nose used to be
Gonna kick you out of my door

Gotta get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Gotta get into a fight

Gonna blow you to a million pieces
Blow you sky high, I don't care
Splatter matter on the bloody ceiling
Blow the building right into the air

Gotta get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Gotta get into a fight
Gonna put the boot right in
Gotta get into a fight
Yeah watch me now

What I want is power, more power
What I need is an innocent life
Want to do it in the broad daylight
I'm the truck, I'm the suicide

Gotta get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Want to get into a fight
Gonna get away with it
Gotta get into a fight
Watch me, watch me now

Yeah gotta get into a fight
Want to caught the bullet
Want to get into a fight
Gonna get away with it

It's all for the greater glory
It's all for a Saturday night
There's a hole where your face used to be
I got you in my telescope sight

Gotta get into a fight
Gonna shoot the bullet
Can't get out of it
Want to get into a fight
Gonna get away with it

I am I said
And I believe
I made it here for something

This is my time
I'm here and now
And I'll fight on
To get there

With prejudice in mind
Through fear nobody sees
Unwilling to accept
This ignorant disease.

By my own right
I have a dream
This is my life
I'm someone.

Look in my eyes
I'm everyman
Feel what I see
Inside you.

A damming of the facts
A way that's negative
Inside we're all the same
We have one live to live

The virus in the heart
Enough to seal your fate
Look deep at what you are
Itt's time to kill the hate

A narrow mind will give
A poisonned point of view
Take care of what you sow
The next one could be you

By opening the door
The end could be so sure
A joining of the hands
To seek and find a cure

I am I said
I am I said

I have a dream
I AM ALIVE

The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe.
We'll fight this battle for years to come
Till we only accept that we can stand on our own.

Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone.
To provide his family with a happy home, alone.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars.

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies.
They are trying to hold you till you'll lie,
It maybe hard, but keep your feet on the ground.
Why don't I have the finer, things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad.
So bad.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't try and get me confused.
Cause I do understand.
And sometimes people need help.
That they may need a hand
When this problems going on.
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand.
And I don't owe you a thing.
So don't think about how sorry
You feel when now your treated so bad.

This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea,
More than one person to fight the fight.
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

And as a race we look back and we've come so far.
While some may conquer,
The others had it so hard.
But instead we just complain
While there's no one for us to fight.
I guess we're born and its how we keep our side to pay.

When did you,
Last look at
At where you are?

Did, did you,
Ever think,
You'd get this far?

Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined

Have, have you,
Realized,
Just where you're from?

Will the choice,
Be, be right,
By what you've done?

Transgressive!
Ingrained
Submissive!
Enchained
Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined

What about,
The point of,
Of no return?

Whilling time,
On bridges,
That, that you burned.

Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!

Transgressive!

Raised by you,
You made me.

In your shadow,
Angry.

Like Father
Like Son

Mirror of your image.
Victim of your damage.

Like Father
Like Son

Like Father
Like Son

You gave me nothing
Like Father
But these memories are full.
Like Son
Is the back of your hand,
Like Father
All that I'll pass on?
Like Son

Here's what you've created.
Shattered,
Cracked,
And wasted.

Like Father
I want to know why.
Like Son

Like Father
The way that you treat me,
Like Son

Like Father
Eats away at your soul.
Like Son
And what's left is your conscience,

Like Father
That's a cancerous hole.
Like Son

I want to know why?
What I have done?
Where you a victim?
The cycle goes on

Trippin' out, oh yeah
I'm freakin' out
This sound is bouncing me
Right on the wall.

Lose myself
I can't control myself
I'm a radio head
That's in free-fall.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Hazy man, oh yeah
I'm blasted man
Out there flippin' through my
paisley mind.

Ride the wave
From cradle
To the grave
Breathe it in with my own kind.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Boned with sound, oh yeah
I'm stoned on sound
No one gets to me
Inside this room.

Spacin' out, oh yeah
I'm racing here
This sound gets in my head
My head goes boooom.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Mind's eye in darkness,
See how they run.

Fools search for nothing,
Stare at the sun.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

Talk to the madmen,
Fill them with lies.
Now pay the piper,
As honesty dies.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

Never,
Never
Blood on their hands
Never
Into quicksand.

What's left to dream for,
This endless line.

Ladders to nowhere;
Blind lead the blind.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

See how they run
Stare at the sun

Fill them with lies;
As honesty dies.

Never,
Never
Blood on their hands
Never
Into quicksand

Fight to the death!!!

Our love has drowned me in a pool of blood,
And now all we can do
is fight for our lives
We are not alone!!!
on this earth alone,
we are surrounded,
by mankind.

Black love is what its called,
and there is no looking back.

The times that we have,
are endless in time,
We will rise to ocassion
and take our revenge.

Before the day we die,
I will say I Do!!!!!!!





Think I'm possessed by demons,
I do their dirty work,
They use me like a zombie
Headaches is all I get.

Lock myself up in my own room,
Ain't comin' out my cage,
They're full of shit and no feeling,
I'll always be in a rage.

Small Deadly Space

Sympathy cries for the devil,
I dance to the music he makes.
Chemical daze, my salvation,
Destroy these losers and fakes.

Fist in the wall, care of family.
Swallow and suck till I4m full.
I need their love and attention,
Like I need lead in my skull.

Small Deadly Space

Leave me alone to my own type,
I ain't a part of the rat race,
A numberless face, just because.

I'll play along with these demons,
Possessed by them every day.
Don't try to reach out and console me,
I'll bite at what gets in my way.

Small Deadly Space

A purple bruise,
A fractured limb,
All covered up with lies.

A swollen face,
A bloody tongue,
This violence denied.

Empty now and meaningless,
Ridiculed in shame,
Until death do us apart,
Who should take the blame?

To live a lie
Forgive or die.

A stricken look,
A lowered head,
Reflections, turning back.

A trembling hand,
A quickened step,
The dreaded, next attack.

Turning from the holy ghost,
Light and spirit fade.
Waiting for deliverance,
Every thing betrayed.

To live a lie
Forgive or die.

A vacant stare,
A beat-up faith,
The book of truth reviled.

A prayer to God,
A plea for help,
Held ransom with the child.

Wide awake and holding tears,
Fear that never sleeps,
Curled up in the bed at night,
The virgin gently weeps.

To live a lie
Forgive or die

Closed into self asylum,
On ice that's paper thin.
Wrapped up for good protection.
Keep that from getting in.

The shadows bring the shelter,
Some refuge from the storm.
Brakes on the helter skelter,
To let these nerves reform.

Retreat out of the mad house,
Stop foaming at the mouth.
Hang up this strange behavior,
Cut through the overgrowth.

Watch from a safer distance,
Observe the next offense.
See how the hands do murder,
Then try to make some sens.

Black vision
Dead body
Oppression

Shock system
Explosive
Depression

Disaster
Malignant
Infection

Inhuman
Sadistic
Rejection

These acts of tender mercies,
Work on the purest soul.
They tease and trap remorseless,
Till six feet in the ground.

Shut down till all is silent,
Be still this seething blood.
Turn off, release the trigger,
Let numbness do some good

There's a man without a home,
With a girl who has no name.
There's a face in every town,
Underneath we're all the same.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on.

When the man felt down and low,
The girl was by his side.
And they walked a broken road,
With a hope that never died.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on.

If the man should find a home,
Then the girl would take his name.
But they need their open road,
For their journey is the same.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on

If I could find a place
To leave this world behind.
Somewhere in time and space
Where i could ease my mind.
I'd take you there;
Where we could be alone.

No one can find this place;
The secret will be ours.
With no more pain to face;
We'll live amongst the stars.
In solitude, and we can wonder free.

Alone, at last just you and me.

Our island universe;
A world unto its own.
Forgetting all the worst of times,
They're gone,
You know we are as one
To make a life of peace.

Escape, into eternal sleep...

Bear witness to treason
Abeyance they cower
Compulsion of liars
Addicted to power

Into the pit
Into the pit

Conspiring for sation
Malfeasance on high
Obstruction of duty
Disorder will rise

Into the pit
Into the pit

Possession by force
Reprisal to task
Defenseless no longer
Expulsion by mass

Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit
Into the pit





Sig sauer, victim of a systems non-control
Devour, striking terror into every soul

Communication breakdown onto self destruction
Schizophrenic people breeding hate
Pessimistic thinking from a failed connection
Survival comes when we annihilate

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun

Paranoia, termination sickness zeros good
Blind power, executing humans in cold blood

Degenerating children with an opiate bullet
Poison flows from words out on the street
Trapped inside the home that has become the prison
Dissin' everybody that we meet

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun

Locked and loaded, governmental loss to anarchy
Weapon goaded, magnum is gagging liberty

Cultural collision in an endless frenzy
Numbing minds with threats of violence
Hopeless to the dream of any decent future
Running on sheer fear and ignorance

Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun
Nailed to the gun





Life in black

You never were there for me
No never at all
You never took care of me
You just watched me fall

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

I placed all my faith in you
I needed you here
Christ knows what I've got to do
To rid me of fear

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

You took me for everything
As long as I live
While There's still one breath in you
I'll never forgive

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

Torn by the wrath that burns like a buried flame
Crossed in the heart from this voice that's a nagging pain
Snared to the book of God with a twisted fear
Help me from being damned by a righteous spear

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

Chained with a crooked stare that conceals a lie
Choked on a love that's judged from an evil eye
Lost in a world of hurt through a sense of doubt
Take all the numbing grief let the poison out

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

Torn by the wrath that burns like a buried flame

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin





 Love me for a little while
 Love me if you can
 'Cause I want to be your man
 And I want to understand You
 Ah...

 If you try to follow, girl
 Please stay close behind
 'Cause I want to be with you
 And I want to love you too
 Or three

 Ah, ah, ah
 Ah...
 Ah, ah, ah

 I don't want to waste your time
 I just want to make you mine
 Ah... whoa-oh-ah

 One, two, three, four, I love you
 And I always will
 'Til the sun falls off the sky
 Gonna love you 'til I die
 And more

[repeat chorus]

Do you remember me
I'm the one you talk about
Do you remember me
I'm the one you booted out

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you
No matter what in the world you say
Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway
Do you remember when
You said that I was your true love
And you'd take care of me
And watch me like the stars above

I just gotta hear you play it one time for everybody now

I just gotta hear you play it one time for the world now.

I said I'm gonna love you anyway
You know I'm gonna love you anyway

Mushroom clouds are forming
And the sky is dark and gray

Little children dying
In a age of hate and war

We can love again
Only God knows when
Help us with our problems

I don't need you bothering me
Can't you tell me that I'm free?

Mushroom clouds are forming
And the sky is dark and gray

I could love you more and more each day for a million years
And I'd sit around all day just crying happy tears

[Chorus]
To dance and sing my life away (life away)
And laughing with you, my darling, softly to me

Orange, sugar, chocolate, hot cinnamon and lovely things and you
And darling, you know there was really nothing else that I could do

And my darling you will never know how elegant
You'll always be to me
And my darling I was so in love it was evident for anyone

To see, and I suppose they already do
And how come so suddenly everything depends on you

And if I kissed you once I'd probably do it again
But then that's not so inconceivable, my friend

I just got out my little red book
        The minute that you said goodbye
        I thumbed right through my little red book
        I wasn't gonna sit and cry
        And I went from A to Z
        I took out every pretty girl in town
        They danced with me  and as I held them

        All I did was talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you... oh, no...

        There ain't no girl in my little red book
        Who could ever replace your charms
        And each girl in my little red book
        Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of
        Oh won't you please come back
        Without your precious love I can't go on
        Where can love be   I need you so much

        All I did was talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you... oh, no...

        Oh won't you please come back
        Without your precious love I can't go on
        It's haunting me   I need you so much

        All I did was talk and talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you
        All I did was talk and talk about you
        Hear your name and I'd start to cry
        There's just no getting over you... oh no

Do you remember me
I'm the one you talk about
Do you remember me
I'm the one you booted out

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you
No matter what in the world you say
Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

Do you remember when
You said that I was your true love
And you'd take care of me
And watch me like the stars above

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you
No matter what in the world you say
Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

I just gotta hear you play it one time for everybody now

No matter what in the world you do
Hey, I'll always be in love with you

Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

I just gotta hear you play it one time for the world now.

Girl, I'm gonna love you anyway

I said I'm gonna love you anyway
You know I'm gonna love you anyway.

Here's my baggage, hand me my staff
I'm leaving on a plane, a boat or raft

My love, I love, so hard to choose
If that were in my mind, it I would use
Oh...

Goin' back to Mother
Leavin' on the double
Think I'll go to Mexico

Orange skies
Carnivals and cotton candy and you
And I love you too you know I do

Nightingale
Prettier than anything in the world
And I love you too
You know I do

You make me happy
Laughing, glad, and full of glee
And you don't have to try, girl
For you it comes so naturally
Right here in my arms

Here's my baggage, hand me my staff
I'm leaving on a plane, a boat or raft

My love, I love, so hard to choose
If that were in my mind, it I would use
Oh

Goin' back to Mother
Leavin' on the double
Think I'll go to Mexico

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love

When the rain is blowing in your face,

I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

To make you feel my love





 I went to Georgia
 I went to Florida
 I went to Missi
 Tripped in Missippi, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh

 I went to Baghdad
 I went to Laurel
 Tripped in the canyon
 My head is still bent, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh

 I went to Johnny
 I went to Conka
 One of them told me
 That he was holding, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh (Ow!)

 I went to Frisco
 Bumped into Cisco
 He had a shoebox
 Behind his icebox, but now
 You I'll be following
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh

Sometimes I feel so lonely
My comedown I'm scared to face
I've pierced my skin again, Lord
No one cares
For me

My soul belongs to the dealer
He keeps my mind as well
I play the part of the leecher
No one cares
For me, cares for me

Look out Joe, I'm fallin'
I can't unfold my arms
I've got one foot in the graveyard
No one cares
For me, cares for me

People check to tell me
What they think is right
I don't listen to them
Don't know day from night
I'll go through life searchin'
Tryin' to find the one
I'd go slip, slip, you'd go slip, slip Away

And I don't need you to help me find my way
I can make it if I just don't see your face

Once I had a problem
Didn't know what to do
Now I've got no problems
All I had was you
Guess I'll keep on searchin'
And try to find the one
'Cause I'd go slip, slip, you'd go slip, slip
Away

Hey Joe where you goin with all that money in your hand now
Well I said hey Joe where you goin with all that money in your hand

Well I said there ain't goin be no hangman putting no noose around me
Well hey Joe where you goin with all that money in your hand
Well I said hey

On all of the A's just put your finger off the be
Then put it back on then up a fret. You'll understand.

In a gazing dazzling glare
As an image stood before me
But he knew not where

A mulatto soul so rare
Intercepted by graviation
Through the mist like air

From the pits of Eden
This image he came from there

One time now
Johnny's turn now

Driven out by Eden's

I don't want to be in your company
I don't need you to take care of me
Let me alone, let me alone, let me alone, can't you let me be
All I want in this world is to say I'm a man that's free

People talk about the way I look
I say come on and say it, I got enough to write a book
But don't they know, don't they know, don't they know it's a waste of breath'
Cause I don't want to be like them, all I want is to be myself
 (Lemme hear you play it one time now)

Don't try to force your smuggled drugs my way
'Cause baby, I cleansed my soul and I say that's the way it's gonna stay
But you can put me down, all around, on the ground, anyway you choose
Get your kicks with your fix, but this time I know it's you who lose

Can't explain
Nothin' seems to be goin' right
Can't explain
Nothin' seems to be goin' right

[Chorus]
Well now you wake up in the mornin'
Find your poor self dead
Well now you wake up in the mornin'
Find your poor self dead

What a shame
You always want to start a fight
Can't explain
You always want to start a fight

[Chorus]

Let it go, what I say, yeah
Can't explain
You always want to start a fight
Can't explain
You always want to start a fight

[Chorus]

Let it go, one more time, yeah

As I sit here thinking
Wondering where I am
Knowing that I could be here but I just sat
That's where I'm at

People walk the shadows
Falling stars appear
Other blinding matches come with their cats
That's where I'm at

I could never go there
It's too close far behind
Hope I never see you
So I won't go run and hide

The requested track is not viewable.

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We kept each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild
Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
Woaho (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild

We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (woah)
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

(You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)

You can't believe that your whole worlds shattered
You used to have it all under control
It's like you've lost everything that mattered
And you're afraid to fall
You've been though it all too many times

And though I know your pain
Without it there's no way
So the say
Yeah oh
You're lying in the rain
Letting it fall across your face
Just to feel alive

[Chorus]
So let's hear it for the ones
Who know what it feels like
To survive a broken heart
Put one hand up in the sky
Tonight
If you know what it feels like
To survive a broken heart
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)

You're searching through all the thought's you've gathered
And it feels impossible
To make it through another day
Where do you turn when your faiths been scattered
And nothing is logical
You've been through it all too many times

And you can feel your pain
But you can't win before you lose
So they say
Yeah oh
You search for who's to blame
When you let go you find the truth
Is just to feel alive

[Chorus]

A thousand pieces on the ground
How do you put them back together once again
And when your world comes crashing down
That's when you rise and find your way up
That's when you find out what you're made of

[Chorus]

Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)
Survivor of a broken heart (You're a survivor, you're a survivor, survivor, survivor)

'I never meant to break your heart, please forgive me.'

No I never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Please forgive me

I never meant to break your heart
I'd give my last breath before I do
Please forgive me

No I never meant to hold you down
I never meant to break your heart
Somehow, somehow
We are survivors

No I never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Here we are standing here
Survivors in the night

No I never meant to break your heart
I'll always be here for you
Here's my word, take my hand
Survivors in the night

No I never meant to let you down
I'd give my last breath before I do
All I ever wanted was to be right here
Survivors in the night

When all is said and done
We'll find a way
To put all this behind us
We'll find some way
Cause you know that I won't be leaving
Yes I'm here and I won't be leaving

No I never meant to cause you pain
No I never meant to hurt you
All I want to do now, is to try my best
Survivors in the night

When all is said and done
We'll find someday
We can forget all this
Somehow, some way

And as long as I'm here
There'll be no worries any more
And all these promises I'm making now
I'll hold each day

So don't ever, don't ever, don't forget
That I never, never meant to break your heart
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you
Survivors in the night

We are survivors in the night

Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million

I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)

I'm a survivor (what?)

Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here

Wishing you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness

The requested track is not viewable.

Cross a windy bridge one winter night
Past Embankment Gardens
Enter warmth and light
Face the music (it's never easy)
Forget the chill
Face the future (it's never easy)
Find the will
If live is worth living
It's got to be done
One might be forgiven
For thinking it's a life on the run
Many roads will cross through many lives
But somehow you survive
Look around
Picture what's in store
Is this the final edit
Or is the subject now a bore?
Don't shrug your shoulders (it's always easy)
You can't ignore
That life is worth living
It's still worth a damn
One might be forgiven for thinking
It's something of a sham
Many words may make it sound contrived
But somehow we're alive
(The Survivors)
Our heads bowed
(The Survivors)
At memorials for other faces
In the crowd
Teachers and artists (it's never easy)
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins
(It's never easy)
Or twinsets-and-pearls
If life is worth living
It's got to be run as a means of giving
Not as a race to be won
Many roads will run through many lives
But somehow we'll arrive
Many roads will run through many lives
But somehow we'll survive





When the waters is rough
The sailing is tough,
I'll get drowned in your love.
You've got a cut throat crew,
I'm gonna sink under you,
I got the bell bottom blues,
It's gonna be the death of me.
It's the graveyard watch,
Running right on the rocks,
I've taken all of the knocks.
You ain't giving me no quarter.
I'd rather drink sea water,
I wish I'd never had brought you,
It's gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor,
Gonna be the death of me,
It's gonna be the death of me.

When you're flying your flags
All my confidence sags,
You got me packing my bags.
I'll stowaway at sea,
You make me mutiny,
Where you are I won't be,
You're gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
It's gonna be the death of me

Soul survivor, that's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking
That's what I'm talking, soul survivor
Soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor

Sold 9 million

You've been my best friend all these years
You've kept holding on to me
Through all the trials and tears
Only you and I could know all
The sacrifices that let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could've said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I
We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter
I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough
To fight together in this thing for life

There were times I lost my mind took
Some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fadin' fast
We held each other close until the rain have passed
We're survivors

A little time and tenderness has
Seen us through the years
We'll still be side by side when
The final smoke has cleared
We're survivors
Together in this thing for life

Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better

When the waters is rough
The sailing is tough,
I'll get drowned in your love.
You've got a cut throat crew,
I'm gonna sink under you,
I got the bell bottom blues,
It's gonna be the death of me.
It's the graveyard watch,
Running right on the rocks,
I've taken all of the knocks.
You ain't giving me no quarter.
I'd rather drink sea water,
I wish I'd never had brought you,
It's gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor,
Gonna be the death of me,
It's gonna be the death of me.

When you're flying your flags
All my confidence sags,
You got me packing my bags.
I'll stowaway at sea,
You make me mutiny,
Where you are I won't be,
You're gonna be the death of me.

Soul survivor, soul survivor.
Soul survivor, soul survivor.
It's gonna be the death of me

Soul survivor, that's what I'm talking about
That's what I'm talking
That's what I'm talking, soul survivor
Soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor

Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance
Now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge
Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the
Eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds
Still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]

Risin' up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance
Now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

[Chorus]

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

Baby, when I think about you, I think about love
Darlin', don't live without you and your love
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the Heaven 'til I'm dyin' on the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you, I think about love
Darlin' if I live without you, I live without love
And if I had the sun and moon, we will shine them
I would give you both night and day of satisfyn'

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Chaos

I wasn't expecting this
Now everything is destroyed
Underneath us are the nothings
Underneath them is a void
Beyond that void is a place
Where figments from bad dreams are banished
Childhood nightmares all come seeking
And adult lo
gic nearly vanished
Chaos
None of this is what I wanted
I truly asked for what I got
Bang the gavel, it's lawlessness
I can't unravel the knot
Half this wretched town is starving
While the other half are bloated
Everybody hates the bastards in p
ower
But their pill is sugar coated
I didn't need any of this
I feel anxiety in my neck
The consequences now apparent
Feeding back unchecked
Incessant blue in spiral coils
Fingers underneath the skin
Adrenaline is not my mistress
But she always k
knows just where I've been

I built these wings
With broken things
Found strewn in me
My nemeses

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I break and bleed
I tear, then feed
The wretchedness
Inside of me

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these
Eyes

Chaos

Reigns

It bits and holds
With fangs, so old
That loathsomeness
So bitter cold

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

Ordo ob kao, 'Order out of chaos', and the idea is that, uh, with the
influence of powerful forces behind the scene, you can bring order out of the
chaos that we see. We know, for instance, that much of the
An eerie order underneath even chaos, as if the finger of God,,
In order and disorder, is always there
I think he has nothing to support this. why-you're so full of it!
Aliens, protecting society how? Chaos happens.
There's too many people here
Gotta learn the way to turn
Hat over eye
Feeling dead more than alive
Give her something to rely on
One more time.
No one hears the sound
Fear is all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby.
No way in, no way out
Empty talk and TV shouts
Got to find the way around
No, you ain't no lifer
In this town.
No one hears the sound
Fear is all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby.
Stop the beat, hear the sound
Time has come for you to speak
Your mind
Can't you hear the sound?
Chaos all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby
Dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee
Learn to fly.

Chaos...

Power, money, holy roads
Information overload
Leave me in the bitter cold to die

Killing time has just begun
Clinging to a holy gun
Leave me in the blazing sun to die

You get nothing for nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie, goodbye

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

Breaking every promise made
Redefine a better way
Asphyxating while I pray, I'm dead

Destroy offend and terrorize
Nothing left to vandalize
You can't make me compromise, I'm dead

You get nothing for nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie, goodbye

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

So if you think you're in control
It's dragging you further down the hole
Right when you thought it all would end
All of the pain is back again
Every attempt to make it stop
Is taking you right back to the top
Nothing you do can change it now
Not that it matters anyhow

Chaos...

Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, you go down
Chaos, you got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

Do you remember in 1969?
Seeing all the skinheads standing in a line
Foaming at the mouth, Waiting for a fight
High boots, cropped hair, what a fucking sight

Come back of the skinhead
Come back of the boot
People that we don't beat up
We're gonna fucking shoot
We are the new breed, we will have our say
We are the new breed, we ain't gonna die

Trouble east London
Trouble in the street
On the street corners
Where the gang still meets
Talking about the weekend
What they're gonna do?
If you ain't careful
They are gonna do you!

Come back of the skinhead

People that we don't beat up

Chaos in the city
Civil war now
Skinheads taking over
Like skinheads know how
Skinhead with his boots on
Nobody's fool
Skinheads taking over
Chaos is the rule!
Chaos, chaos, chaos, don't give a toss
Chaos, chaos, chaos, don't give a toss!

Complication's my claim to fame
And I can't believe there's another
Constantly just another
I can't avoid what I can't control
And I'm losing ground
Still I can?t stand down
And I know, yeah I know, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you stay true when my world is false
Everything around's breaking down to chaos
I always see you when my sight is lost
Everything around's breaking down to chaos

It?s hard to trust anyone again
After all the let downs I've been through
Haunted by what I've been through
Air still trapped while I still can't breathe
And I'm screaming out
Give me hope somehow
And I know, yeah I know, yeah

[Chorus x2]

Chaos, chaos
I know you stay true, yeah
I know you stay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you stay true, everything around's breaking down
I know you stay true, everything around's breaking down

[Chorus x2]

Lift your head
They're a thousand miles away
Lift your heart
The sky's not coming down today
Try to understand
There's no logic in their plans
But never turn away
From the problems that we face
Turn your back
On the chaos of this town
Turn your head
From the danger that surrounds

We your rhyme sayers we lead you like a beacon
Of light out of the chaos cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare we're the winners of the game
Walk in we'l prepared climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under
Ground heard the sound of the clap made you wonder
If it was a gun the crowd or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger
Now I'm much older, lyrical clap MC's
If you don't know by now, let me aquaint you with my steez
(C'mon) I don't get on stage and waste your time
Niggaz got a lot to say but they just can't rhyme
They just babies, I snatch em out they incubators
Attach them to respirators, they breathin hard like Darth Vader
Hard as candy and suck like Now or Laters
After a while your style's tasteless and it GOT NO FLAVOR

Projects my eyesights to the heavens like dead or wise sages
Release what I hold save it through my book of rhyme pages
Scripts be ageless, like scrolls from dead sea
The cadence off and on like the motion of Tai Chi
Ba-ha-ma-D, wor-dy, to Reflect, Eternally
Science to a remedy to help and get my people free, but
Little support, got my thesis on freeze
My only option's doin bootlegs for the Japanese
Get about eight G's, a heavy buzz overseas
Sacrifice a pill to mainstream and do what I believe, cause
Down to the chromosomes I'm a purist to this artform
Enlighten who I touch and let the world catch on

Yeah, we your rhyme sayers, who lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, we're the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

Oppose for the nine, how no content sections of the earth
Walkin vexed, out of my sticks, laced on every verse
My cells begin to peak at least a hundred thousand hertz
Meanin my joint's prevalent in Fat Beats and Footworks
I cater to these markets first, cause they gravitate to me
And appreciate the vision of what I do musically

Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm!!
I walked in and they stared, see how they screwin me
Break you down, til you ain't the man you used to be
Domination of my jurisdiction, people's addiction to lies
It blurs the lines between the fact and fiction
Now we back omission, I fix your face for you, keep yappin
You start to hate the man in the mirror like Michael Jackson

Majors they try to hold me captive but mine are figure factions
But the foundation of hip-hop hold my braincells for ransom
I chance none, fuck them spots on charts and number one
If it's meant, then I'll accept it gracious when the time comes
This grassrooted curriculum, got me sprung like twisted ankles
Experience is missable, so I approach it from all angles and
Inject some substance deep inside of rap's core
Take an MC and back to where it was before

Call us Liberty like the Bell of Philadelphia scenery
Me and Bahama-D, style free like Mumia need to be
Seein me, feelin me, we right here on the level
Turnin hardrocks to pebbles, exposin the devil
Lyrical olympian like John Carlos winnin gold medal
Take that bass out yyour voice you talk to me in treble
I'm _Serious_ as Steady be	 so you know I ain't playin
I'm stimulatin, makin crowds MOVE like organizations in Philly
Keep it positive, my prerogative is exercise
See through the chaos with my third eye
Word I exhibit the exquitiness, since a child I was vivid
Throw your hands in the air if you with it, dig it

Yeah, we your rhyme sayers, who lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, we're the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

Seven-eighteen, to five-one-three
We meet at two-one-five
Reflection Eternal, Bahamadia, yes yes

Yo listen the fuck up why'all
It's Mr. X to the Z Xzibit
Broadcastin with the home grown
That's right, they straight out of my backyard
The Beat Junkies, on Rawkus Records understand me?
It's Soundbombing 2!

[Verse 1]
Yo yo yo
Now ain't nobody fuckin wit the mastermind
I'm like Einstein, a hundred and fifty times magnified
Nickel and Teslin, Jon Von Neuman

All wrapped up in the body in one human
I rhyme the tightest, shine the brightest
I blind the optic fibers in anybody's iris
When it comes to rappin, I'll smash your ass

Whether you Latin, Black or Anglo-Saxon
I'll smack you wit a backhand
That crack your back like chiropractors after lookin at your catscan
In between albums, I've become a masked man like Batman

And stalk my own rap fans
I'm like a madman fightin a war
Throwin lightning rods, swingin lightning swords
Blow you away wit a force that'll leave your body lost

Gone, nothin to mourn, nothin to do a autopsy on
I rock till I can't rock no more
'Til I can't get no mothafuckin props no more
'Til they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour

'Til 2000 B.C. ain't hot no more
I'm a dragon wit the head of a lion, jaws be like saws grindin
Claws rip through walls of cast iron
I slap fire outta hoodlum, pull out steel and start shootin

I clap iron like Duke Nukeum
Try to attack 'Bis, you get your face stomped
Flatter than a compact disc wit black Timbs
Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim
Flatter than the knife *Jigga* stabbed Un wit

[Chorus]
If you the first nigga that laugh
I'll blow you in half
The first nigga to talk trash
I'ma blow you in half
The first nigga to show your ass
I'll blow you in half
The first time'll be your last
'cause I'ma blow you in half

[Verse 2]
Yo check it *beat comes in*
I destroy your whole city block when I'm ready to rock
Blow the speaker box, magnetically shielded or not
Magnetically energy poppin gates of radio waves

Oscilate lyrics and beats copulate to pop your tape
Manipulatin space in large proportions
Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talkin
About shit like supernatural forces

Gnomes and theories and superstring theories
Most of you mothafuckers barely
Even understand the English language, much less think clearly
When I die, will I go to Heaven or Hell

Or will I end up in a place called the Van Allen Belt
I researched my roots, lookin for proof
The best place to hide a lie is between two truths
The aftermath of a nuclear blast

When the average death sentence becomes a dead paragraph
I dig a 5 by 9 rectangle in the grass
Reach your epitab and bury your ass
As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly
I'll sing all of your greatest hits, oldies on karaoke





Let it go
Oh, yeah, we got drums
Woo, Alkaholiks, let's get it crackin' y'all
Ay J-Ro, teach these niggaz how to stunt

People gather round, J-Ro is on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, sing songs called 'Survival'
Chillin' in my drawers in hotels like the Bible
Alkaholiks, West coast legends is the title

I can't shoot you with my knife, I can't stab you with my gun
So the only thing left is to hit you with the drums
Uh, huh, uhh, we in this bitch, no kickin' back
J-Ro, tell these niggaz where the fuck you sippin' at

Yo, I'm sippin' on the dock of the bay, puffin' on hay
Used to sell bombay and sip Andre
West West like Kanye, I got the rhythm like Kwame
I used to have a crush on Shante

Yo, E-Swift, I don't think that you bent
But goddamn homeboy, where all the gin went?
J-Ro, yo, I believe that's me
Say what? You up next on the Hennessey

And once you hear the Capital J, rap, it'll stay
In your brain all day, it always happens that way
I come from L.A., Cali, East side of the Valley
Dilly-dally, ran through an alley

Runnin' through an alley in my corduroy flip-flops
We drink a lot of beer so it's that West coast hip-hop
Kick box our way out of trouble, just to bubble
Meet us at the bar y'all, where everybody love you

Yo, my rhymes at parties, took out more MC's than brown Bacardi
I'm totally gnarly
Stumble through the crowd like excuse me, pardon me
Sip hops and barely 'til I pop an artery

My beats so fly, niggaz try to charter me
I'm an Alkaholik but that's only one part of me
My main man Tash is like Cool Raoul
He got bitches butt-naked in the swimming pool

I'm rowdy, I'm cocky, I'm like Jeremy Shockey
I'm a giant in this game, y'all better back up off me
You also the most frosty, drink until we saucy
Keep bitches up all night like black coffee

Yeah, you know Cinnamon, she hang with crazy Kim and them
They always in the club, tryin' to take a nigga's Benjamins
Feminine women, we be runnin' all up in 'em
Then we send 'em home broke
Because we wouldn't spend a cent on 'em

Aiyyo CaTash, a people person, shake hands and kiss babies
Politician in my mission, stack grands and spit crazy
I roll with a tight crew like Mushmouth and Russell
Girls wanna grab my love muscle and suckle

Got trees in my duffel, get a ride from the airport
I take the shuttle, no need for rebuttal
Huddle round your speaker, got the system blastin'
And we takin' everything, it ain't no need for askin'

Got the headbangin' beats, so nigga pass the aspirin
We bumrushin' the door in an un-orderly fashion
This is the year that we cash in
Catch me in Miami in the sun just baskin'

Catch me in L.A. in the streets just mashin'
The name is E-Swift, I move quick when I'm dashin'
I'm swift on the cut with my hands when I'm scratchin'
Alkaholiks back and the legacy's lastin'

Carjack used to fix flat tires (Get your ass out of the car now!)
Cadillac used to be a Benz (hey, get out of the street)
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost you in the end

I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today

He's gay used to mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed (alright)
You're played used to mean top forty

She's been waiting for that special someone
Anguished by the tears left behind them
Fortifying all that lying
Putrid taste left in her mouth

Follow me, follow me

Follow me, follow me
Down

Yeah, c'mon
Let's do the maniac
Maniac, bumping like a brainiac
Brainiac, I don't remember [?]
Land me down, touch me down at heathrow
Reach down, the first time I ever feel
Bouncers [face?] on 57th st
Calm down, I feel a cool breeze and
Not particular
I think I found a reason
[For I saw?] what I saw

She's been waiting for that special someone
But then look what she's got left
Fortifying all that lyingputrid taste left in her mouth

Reach down, the first time I ever feel
Bouncers [face?] on 57th st
Calm down, I feel a cool breeze and
Not particular
I think I found a reason
[For I saw?] what I saw

Blood runs cooler than you flow
She is hiding smiles behind whispers and tears
Chaos reaches higher ground

Chaos, chaos, chaos

You make sure you never lose
You only want to win
You use your head to find new
Ways to make people give in
Taking what they have
Becoming a good friend
But now that they have seen the light
You'll come to your end
Never giving nothing, Always giving a lie
Never giving nothing, People sussed your sly
You always take without giving
You've never heard of honesty
Times are hard for everyone else
But you can't bloody see
People queuing at your door
Begging for some food
You just slam the door on them
And tell them to get screwed

Spending money you have saved
Working all your life
Give it to the people
Who control boring life
Living without living
Fashion you must change
To be in with the in-crowd
Who live their life the same
Fashion you must change
To keep up with the trend
The money you are saving
Is coming to an end
People, they will follow
The changing of the trend
The fashion they have chosen
Will create a financial friend
Six months, they have passed
Another fashion comes
Work some boring overtime
To help the financial friend

You'll never have the authority
To be in charge of me
So don't give me your orders
Or your boring commentary
Just because you think
You're of a so called better breed
You seem to think that you're so special
But you don't fucking own me
Use me to make money
In your shitty factories
And I'll have to live and suffer
On a pathetic salary

Don't you look outside your window
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
People stare and you don't know
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
You watch people come as they go
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
Tally on and nowhere to go
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
The end is nigh or so they reckon
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
What's that flash on the horizon?
I don't know
I don't know

They're only going through a phase
Kids are all the same
They don't know their own right minds
It's only a silly game
They don't know what their talking about
They just talk a load of shit
If we just ignore them
They'll forget about it
Parental love is just a farce
Don't be taken for a ride
We know you're only young
But feel free to speak your mind
Do not work and do not pray
Ignore the bores at school
Live your life your own way
Don't be nobody's fool
Counteract the system
Youngsters are the best
Counteract the system
Become a real pest

Politicians one after one
Creating havoc and having fun
Pulling our lives to bits and pieces
Sucking and crawling like common leeches
Vote for me, I'm SDP
No vote labor, no vote Tory
You don't know which one to choose
It doesn't matter, you'll always lose
You're just a load of pointless bastards; You haven't got a brain
You're just a load of pointless bastards; You're driving me insane
What makes people vote 'em in
I can't see the reason
There's no justice in the lot of 'em
They're all just legalized treason
Police harassment on our streets
Nuclear war at our feet
Unemployment up again
It's just for their financial gain

Don't want to be your fucking hero
Don't want to be your fucking star
They use your money and exploit your name
Using people is the name of the game
They say wear bondage and a messy suit
You're just another dumb recruit
Don't know what we're gonna do
We just can't get through to you
They take your money; You work so hard
But you'll just get an unemployment card
In the day, you're just a lad
You're a poser, it ain't so bad
I ain't a poser or a fucking star
I don't drive a flash fucking car
Chaos in society, you're to blame
In years to come, it'll be the same

By and by, you knew that you make me cry. (By and by, knew you'd make me cry)
And my love for you will never die. (My love will never, never die)
But I had to find out on my own.

(Check yourself, check yourself)

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I paid no mind. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself)
All down the line. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Sometimes you just got to lose.
That's when you pay your dues.
I guess I was a fool, I guess I was a fool,
To think that... you'd stayed so true.

Aww, I really played in the game. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'd always win. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Now the tables turn. (Check yourself, check yourself)
And I'm on the losing end. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Oh don't, feel sorry.
I had it coming, it's true.
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you.

Before I go, I'd like for you to know.
You've had my heart from the very start.
But there's one more thing, before we part.
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart.

Aww, I'm on my sad way. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Because I know I'd lost your love. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'll kick it, like a pass. (Check yourself, check yourself)

But I'll be thinking of....
The good times. (The good times)
The bad times. (The bad times)
But good or bad, happy or sad,
Of memories. (Memories)
Sweet, sweet memories. (Memories)
Aww, memories... are all I have.

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they... what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Death is comin', I'm tryna warn 'em
That's why I was summoned
I know that they don't want it, they want what they can't have
Euphoria come and go and it's something you can't grab
Still, we're grasping for the emptiness, hoping we can catch something
Hand full of scars, cuts, burns, and some flesh wounds
Verge of insanity, stop me 'for I'm gone
Yeah, I say I'm gon' quit but I'm back at it in the morn'
It goes on and on and on and now I'm used to it
It's a lifestyle now and I don't know what else to do
Got a war inside my soul and it's wantin' to break through

Tell me what you're gonna do
I know that you know that I'm on
To you
I see your game and I see
The way
With my self esteem you love
To play
When I'm feeling fine things
Go alright
You're sure to be right by
My side
But when I'm down I look around
You're nowhere to be found
Here they come again
Will this ever end
Around till I need them
My plastic friends
They melt when heat begins
They're walking mannequins
My plastic friends
I wonder if you'll ever see
Exactly what you've done to me
I feel alone I've been attacked
And you put the knife into
My back
What I need is honesty
Open exchange from you to me
I've come to you my
Pride aside
So we can make this right
Three times denied I've
Relied too long on visions
Capsules of elastic
Mental prisons
Relating to the masses
For thirty pieces
Candy coated personality thin
Like reece's
Synthetic figments artificial
Pigments
[pathetic] ingesting poisons
Of facades
Illusions on a mountain high
Like Colorado
Bravado London bridges they
Be falling
Value of fools gold with
Kisses manifested
Break, smash, shatter
Counterfeit flatter
Imitation of a friend 'cause
The heat makes you scatter
Blending, comprehending but
Still deceiving
Aimless inventions creations
Spiritual manipulations
I'm running out of patience
Fascinated in your attempts
At being plastic
Spastic, kind of drastic my
Companion you are not

In this world of make believe
My eyes see what I want to see
I'm blinded with the simple lies
So easily I justify

The sin that comes so naturally
Is this all that I'll ever be
Bring this madness to an end
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride
I think I've had enough

Spinning 'round, up and down
But I know it's alright
Move ahead, falling back
Try to leave it behind

Seems I've been here before
So familiar I can tell
Need your help to get off
Of my sin carousel

It's suffice to say I move
Because of your great fortitude
So unstable are my feet
They love to make a fool of me

Afraid to fall I feel corrupt
And as I drop, you pick me up
Take me were I've never been
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride
I think I've had enough

Spinning 'round, up and down
But I know it's alright
Move ahead, falling back
Try to leave it behind

Pullin' down strongholds
Pullin' down strongholds

Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires
Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires

I got my feet dirty 'cause I'm splashing in the puddles
Got me crazy no room for rebuttals
I let down my guard like doug I got lazy
Hazy vision blurry in a hurry for immoral satisfaction

My heated passion desires, I shoulda put out the fires
That smolder in my mind, time after time, time after time
Will you help me God to just find my own way

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Actual facts keep the theories intact
Mental premonitions speaking flesh to rest
I will not go, I will not bow
Shapes and silhouettes making things complex

Unleashing chemicals give my body a sign
A loss of control leads to moral regret
Seduction, repercussion where I must defend
Entering in the trinity within to fight sin

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen to you
As a result of making these rebellations?

Inventive measures taken I feel my defenses breaking
Independent of all wisdom, secondary senses shaken
In time I arrive battered, beaten and scarred
Sensitivity charred from character barred

So hard to say goodbye to yesterday's dreamin'
Still pullin' weeds from seeds of yesterday's schemin'
Elusive representation of putting mercy to test
Confessed in midnight sessions of my desires suppressed

Entangled similes I've been meaning to comprehend
Conformed by the ways wearing dark shades
Covering up my vulnerability
You can see, I can see this lust is tempting me
To break the chains to avoid devastation, I pray for strength daily

Co-existing remedial rhymes
 with verbal signs
Disseminating inner visions
 to contrive
Broken pieces cobblestones
 they pull me down
Redirection for protection
 confessing
Animosity when your voice
 grows faint
Submission at your feet they
 feel the stings of complaint
Doing what it takes I'm
 taking table crumbs
Dependence on the one
 popularity is done
Expedient the main
 ingredient as I grasp
For the hands of providence
 to circumvent attacks
From the enemy though they
 come against me
Will I listen to your voice
 to infinity
Speak to me 'cause I long for
 your grace
Show me things as I seek
 your face
Here I am I'll do anything
Say want you want from me
A contradiction in my
 directions got me guessing
Do you listen? not to
 mention my phones off the
 hook look
I took control of
 my own path disregarded
 your wrath
Stinky like a day without a
 bath but
Internal convictions oppose
 my addictions
To inventions less eternal
 paternal
Affection from elevated places
 smiling faces
Whisper love in aimless spaces
I hear your voice won't you
 let me follow
Knees bent so we can shoot
 the breeze signs I
 can swallow
Keep the lines open like
 fiber optic hot like
 the tropic
If your driving this train
 let me hop it
Say what you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you speak to me
Wha do you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you
 speak to me

Take time, what's on your mind?
Everybody's standing on another side
It's a chance for personal gain
If you're gonna play on someone else's shame

Take time, share another life
Perfect to the end and taking on our strife
Take the time to clear up your mind
Put away yourself and open up your eyes

This time, I started waiting for myself to fade
Walking in to complications and I rearrange
Do I fear my feelings, am I numb to pain?
Are my senses washing me sane, will it ever go away?

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading

So come on it's about time
Love is so blind, you're walking on the line
Set your mind on ease, take a turn for me please
Would you please?

If you sit back, look at your life
Look at yourself and set back your pride
Take the time for what's on your mind
Put away yourself and open up your life

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Today I want to get away
I want to go some place where I can pray and
Go where the trees are tall
Where the water rushes to the falls

Fly, I want to fly away to a place where they can't find me
I, I want to see the stars that shine and I'll land on mars
And run, I want to run all day far away where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter place

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do

Today I want to get away
Where the skies are clear most every day
I'll go where the river runs
Washes away my field of pain

Fly, I want to fly up high let my spirit soar I'll kiss the sky
I want to go to the place where I find you
Run, I want to run all day to a place where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter day

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away

An urgent sense of regret and now I'm caught in the zone
My mind arrested by fear and so I go it alone
A metamorphosis conceived by the early light
Distraction of self comes out in the night

Fabricated, I'm constructed of opinions and lies
Which only leads to failing in my own eyes
Sinking to the depths while I'm masking what's inside
A bittersweet existence and I cause my own demise

And I wonder if you've ever seen life through
The eyes of one who understands what it mean
To be free, freedom comes when you can let it go
But I guess you wouldn't know

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Mind reflects the meaning to things that are jumbled
Resting on the first, making time to rehearse
Intricate persona, controlled animation
Visually impaired, clinging to pain immersed

Mentally scarred, cosmetics dripping down
Life in forward motion, exist in reverse
Instable at the seams, trying to conform
Trapped in a maze while sin is at its worst

And I wonder what your gonna do, when your
Disguise comes crashing down and yourself
Comes shining through, are you gonna hide your face?
Or let it rest in the hands of grace, grace

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade
Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade

Dimensions of intervention
Are needless so I think
Striving and thriving I see
I'm driving to the brink

Avoiding annoying eternal
Complications destinations
Unimportant constantly
Distorting my relations

From patience to thoughts of
Hating anyone in my mind
I find it hard to believe you
Can relate to my kind

And if I could I would
Pretend that I'm alright by myself
If you love me as I am I'll
Put my pride on the shelf

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
Skepticism leaves a wrinkle on my brow
Cynicism prevents my change
With this suspicion I'm caught in a dilemma

Intervention with my psyche?
Rearrange walls built to hinder
The intrusion
Preservation of my mental well being

Doubt makes me value the
Safety of my distance
Can it be stubbornness to
Which I cling?

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
And if I climb a wall of pride
Swim across my sea of doubt
Will you love me as I am, the way I am

Good, God y'all

There's no such thing as perfect strangers
So I come to you the way I am
If you call on me to sacrifice
I won't promise that I can

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

We will wake up when the moment's gone
And I'll still feel you on my fingertips
But they'll be nothing in the after burn
But the taste upon our lips

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

I'm not here tonight to rescue you
And you don't need me in your life
But I know I'll have the best of you tonight

We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire

you'll never know how many bridges you'll burn

I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew.
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say,
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where it felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you.

I set fire to the rain,

He is the flame
He draws me in
That burns within
It's a pain, it's so sweet, oh
The fix, the craze, by now he needs
Only I can't breathe
And I just can't pull away
Can't get away, oh, oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

My hands they're burnt, they're black, they bleed
And embers asleep
My whole world is cold now
The blaze, the heat he's putting out
Can't live without
Yeah, I just can't pull away,
Can't get away, oh, oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

Oh

Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream
While the children play in the field
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life
But how strong is the shield?
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground
Where sky is forever blue

So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud
Which may take me from you

Many things a man can lose
His self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb
To the hill up above

Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield

So trust in you love, and Lucy of above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield

The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground
And to his wish he will yield

Fate will have it's word, of course
(Think this line is wrong)
And time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield

You've fallen once, you'll fall again
And lean on
Your tired hands that crawl and grasp
The soft ground
By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

And every stone and every step
I won't recall
Emptied out of every thought
Just soft ground
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun in your eyes

Gone at last
Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

It overflows, it overflows, it always runs
It overflows, it overflows, it always runs
Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows

Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surround you, always glows
Oh

Look on your face,
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes

Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

The sky keeps staring at me
Frozen in my tracks (Nothing else to see)
And when I move my face left
You're always standing there (A shadow I can't see)
And even then I can't trace
You're walking away

I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down (Nothing I can hear)
I found the worst half in me
We're cut off at the knees (Can't even take a stand)
Against your words and beliefs
We didn't wanna freeze

(All of the years, leaving me here Gun-shy)
I don't want to say it all again (the pain, losing my aim)
Never seem to see (And why?)
Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes (Recite)
A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)

The cold keeps tearing at me
Slowing down my blood,(Unable to speak)
I left my mind long ago
Choosing some false (Always letting go)
And when I try to face you
You're walking away

(All of the years, leaving me here Gun-shy)
I don't want to say it all again (the pain, losing my aim)
Never seem to see
(And why?) Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes
(Recite) A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)

Yet again we're the only ones
No surprise, this is often how it's done
Lately it's about all I can take
I will move and mend and mold this break

Shell with another crack
I'm small but I can keep track
Too soon, everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take score, even playing fields this game
I know when all's said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Past the roaring shore
I have nothing left to hear
I'm chasing all the words
But everything you say I only see
But honestly it's fine
When I mention how I love you
It's all I do, even as I stray

We have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
My most is nothing more
Than a place we've been before
We'll draw and drag it on
I'm telling you I'm trying
To hear this out
I want nothing more to doubt
A little bit of shame

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out so long
Unhinged, unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there, still as you were

At the end of the line
It is as if there's no time at all
Nothing left to win
Every pleasure burned to the wick
Content to be alone
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
Why I'm even here

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out, so long
Unhinged, unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there, still as you were

Talk to yourself
Please make your mind up
Is there anything left
At all, all, all
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

I never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Weary when I do us wrong
But we try
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Best just lie down
And close your eyes for once
Before your will just goes

Surrounded by the throng
A mounting wave of sound
The clamor breaks me down
The ground beneath me gone
The sky might open up

Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh
Ah, oh, oh

Those saints in lockstep
All crossed the wasteland
Forever gone
They'll hum and walk along

Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

And it calls you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please, not so long
This time

Too young and thoughtless
To calm your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone

Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright

And it'll call you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please, not so long
This time

Move on, let's face
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time, no place
When all you hope is that everything breaks

No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No bliss, no light
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
I'm still the lucky one

Prove it all to me
Check again to see
Leave me with no words
If you call again it's absurd
And I know I've made it all a lie
Shuffled back and forth it's only in my eyes
And I always want to rescind
Everything I bought into, there's no name

Fool me once, it's fair
The flood gates need repair
I count on you and why
There's nothing there besides
And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign
Another back and forth, turn around
One that makes no sense, but it feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
Where you are you and I stay me

If I draw you upside down I can let go
Leaves my mind at ease gives me something to focus on
Could I be alone?
Could I be alone?

If I speak in rounds for a while letting my tongue swell
I'll be sure to try and explain myself to dispel
Blame it on the day
Blame it on the day

Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost, what's left before it's gone

But what makes each step worth the time and regret still shows
In the cradle of my unruly chest you belong
Take it as it is
Make another fist

Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Step down, just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost, what's left before it's gone

Dreamed a long day
Just wandering free
Though I'm far gone
You sleep nearer to me

If I could find peace
If this night bleeds
But I can't help myself

So I walk out
These wandering dreams
Of the north road
Dressed gold and green

If I could lie still
As that grey hill
But I can't help myself

But it's calm and it's clear
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked

And those figures through the leaves
And that light through the smoke
And those countless empty days
Made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way
Than straight on out the door

And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself

Sometimes I'm battle weary
I forget to use my shield
The arrows pierce my armor
And I stumble in the filed

A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

I'll think my life is over
But the Lord he comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And he sets me on my feet

A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

Sometimes your battle weary
But the war's already won
Keep your head and hold your shield high
'Til your days of life are done

A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

So much violence in our name
A life, a silence masked in shame

Children running in the streets
Soldier boots are on their feet
Mothers bare the burdens of our defeats
Fathers are on their knees praying for mercy

So much violence in our name
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
So much violence in our name
A life, a silence masked in shame

No more, no more, no more (no more)
No more, no more, no more (no more)
No more, no more, no more (no more)
No more, no more, no more (no more)

Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield

No more violence in our name

No more, no more, no more

How do you propose to live your life in times like these

Growing up surrounded by the fear and hate disease

I believe that we all need protection from the world

And our friends enfold us like a barrier unfurled

I believe in the human shield

I believe in the human shield

People try to use you and abuse you every day

Doesn't seem to matter what you do or what you say

Then you need a friend that you can count on when you're down

Someone who will ward off all the hatred all around

The human shield protects your soul

And keeps you on the ground

The human shield protects your heart from being ground down

Dreams will all be shattered and your hopes dashed on the ground

As you grow to realise, this world's a real hard town
I believe that we all need protection every day
And our friends will form a shield that works in every way

I believe in the human shield
I believe in the human shield

(Chorus)

I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

A you've been makin' your brags around town
That you've been a lovin' my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what a you look like to me
And what I see's a pity
You better close your face and stay outta my way
If ya don't wanna go to fist city

If ya don't wanna go to fist city
Ya better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift a you off a the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint 'cause he ain't
N' that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man
If ya don't wanna go to fist city

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet
If you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called fist city

If you don't wanna go to fist city
You better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift you offa the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby's a saint 'cause he ain't
N' that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man
If ya don't wanna go to fist city
I'm here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man
If ya don't wanna go to fist city

striking out at everyone
feels like no one's listening
suddenly it's not the same
you've been sleeping all this time
throw your fist into the air
for all the trouble you went through
where are you know
are you so cool you don't care
for everything you tried to prove
the time is now
seeing the world through colored glass
picture postcards of your life
welcome to the world outside
this is where your troubles lie
staring straight into the sun
burn the cobwebs from your eyes
you're just up against yourself
there is nothing left to hide

Gotta make this money
Gotta make this money
This money is me
This money is everything I do and see

Who are you to judge me
Just let me be and let me breathe
I see this whole world headed for damnation
And I'm ready to leave

I can't believe this whole world twisted me
You fuckin' biggets, you fakes, you want to-be's
I see the future and its lookin' grim
A lake of fire lookin' like a gonks whip

I'm a fist of rage (one foot in the grave)
I'm a fist of rage (far from saved)
I'm a fist of rage (in a broken state)
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a wrist of hate)
I'm a fist of rage!
I'm a fist of rage!
I'm a fist of rage!
Crack another bottle and let me knock one back

Huh-huh, Slim Jim's
And the tin men grins
Fat heads with dreads
And all the feds growing shark fins

Huh-huh, my girls knocked up
We're in love but she's young and yo I think I'm being locked up
I couldn't cut the mustard with a Ginsu
And a twist of brown for all the bullshit I been through

I'm looking for love but it's got too many damn faces
I can't win even with these four aces
My place is here in the mix with the tricks and sickos
I spend g's but only make nickels

My soul tickles
But this ain't even fun and games
My heart bleeds from the pleasures of the pain
My fuse is short and it's lit like me I'm short

It's sketchy
It's getting hard to see
My heart bleeds believe it every dying breath
These people take and they take
Until there's nothing left

I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage! (one foot in the grave)
I'm a fist of rage! (far from saved)
I'm a fist of rage! (in a broken state)
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a wrist of hate)
Trouble

Ya feeling bold with me
You're up a creek
And you don't know it
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it
And I know it

'Cause the fear you hide your eyes show it
Payback on your ass cause you're over due and I know I owe it
Now when your goin' down bet I'll be blowing up
Hear the sound of a shotgun cock and realize you're fucked

I hope you see my middle finger from the stage
(Feel me coming, feel me coming, feel me coming, feel me coming)

I'm a fist of rage (one foot in the grave)
I'm a fist of rage (far from saved)
I'm a fist of rage (in a broken state)
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a wrist of hate)

If you that call, if you that jump
Arms in the air, Shawty do the fist pump

Don't really wanna see me no more
Can't say we gang high, ballin' like a bank shot

From standin' up when we leave the club
I'm a call that shit a miracle

Twist up, mixed up, twist up
And her booty too big for the seats in my coup
I'm a have to put it in the pick-up truck

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Carry forth as a guardian to Kingdom Come
With your daggers of the spirit
Let the dagger run
With the Fist of Fire
Be the master now
As the darkness of ages past

Riches silver and gold
In the liquid see
Cast a net can you catch
So you can't see me

As in death you can climb
Higher through the sky
Show your wings
Surely you can fly

Fly away past the guardian to Kingdom Come
See the miracle of life
Disappear it's gone

Go carry your silver ships of light
Go carry your silver ships of light
Go carry your silver ships of life
Go carry your silver ships of life
Go carry your silver ships of life

Keep the fire in your hand
It won't let you drown
As you fly with your wings
Won't come falling down

See the flower of youth
Disappear on high
As you gather your true wings
About to fly

To be ready
To be strong
Make it run

This righteous
This wrong
This right
This love

This is how nature controls
The way of all things
this is how the angels sing
Not afraid
No, not afraid
Not afraid of this or that
Not afraid

Carry forth as a guardian to Kingdom Come
With the ghost
And the spirit
Let the fire run

through the darkest age
We can surely fly
through the darkest age
With the Fist Of Fire
through the darkest age
With the Fist of Fire

Well now I've been on my own for many a year
Seems like I'll never get loved
Got me a hand on this brother of mine
And I'm gonna get me the rub
Turn me the lights down to a purple glow
Put Bessie Smith on the wail
Bring me the five young daughters
And help my ship to set sail

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

When I'm downtown in Barcelona
When I'm pissed or when I'm pissed off
Mother Fist just gives me her tender kiss
And some of her sexy stuff
And I lock my door from the inside
Turn my mind to sweet sweet pain
And I wail just like Yma Sumac
Mother Fist she never complains

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

Now I don't care if I'm in a prison
In confinement solitary
A soldier lost in the legion
Or a sailor out on the sea
A beggar, thief or a rich man
A gunman mercenary
A one legged crook
An Armenian cook
As long as my mother's with me

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oppress the power that exists
Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oh the power that exists

In the land of freedom, I will make a clean
Forth rack on production [?] this is all insane
Heart of the heartland or they stream the blood
Where invisibly, for one thousand and third

Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oppress the power that exists
Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oh the power that exists

No alliance, sure no cross to bear
No crack to follow, no police to share
Apathetic revolution, people go put to sleep
As the people are wake up they'll be rioting the streets

Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oppress the power that exists
Raise your fist (raise your fist)
Against the power (raise your fist)
Oh the power that exists

The wish you plead and the things you sought
We all think, we all thought
The things I've done, and the world I've seen
Don't measure up to my queen
Oh, I take one for the other, and work my way through this machine

God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh no
God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh

The first train out, the last one draws
We'll all sing, we're going home
As the curtain swings in to cover all our secrets kept, our love enough

God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh no
Oh girl, this is what I've become
And I'm going to leave it up to you
What are you going to do?

'Cause I don't want to lose your hold on me
'Cause I don't want to lose your hold on me

God damn this cursed iron fist
When I lose control
Oh no
God damn, this is what I've become
And I'm going to leave it up to you
What are you?
What are you?

Just remember
Pay no attention to this iron, this iron fist
Just remember
Pay no attention to this iron, this iron fist

God damn, this cursed
God damn, this cursed
God damn
God damn, this cursed
God damn, this cursed

Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here

You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose your track
Can't go on but you can't go back

Beast of evil devil's house
Tooth and claw they pull you down

Too many problems
Oh why am I here
I need to be me
'Cause you're all too clear
And I can see
There's something wrong with you
But what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely you got no one
You get your body in suspension
That's no problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you

Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want
Then you'll fade away
You won't find me working
Nine to five
It's too much fun a being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You won't find me living for the screen
Are you lonely all your needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do

Problem, problem

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you
Problem

I ain't equipment, I ain't automatic
You won't find me just staying static
Don't you give me any orders
For people like me
There is no order

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
I'll leave it to you
Problem, the problem is you
You got a problem
What you gonna do

They know a doctor
Gonna take you away
They take you away
And throw away the key
They don't want you
And they don't want me
You got a problem
The problem is you

Problems, problems, problems all day long
Will my problems work out right or wrong
My baby don't like anything I do-o-o
My teacher seems to feel the same way too

Worries, worries pile up on my head
Woe is me I should have stayed in bed
Can't get the car my marks ain't been so go-o-ood
My love life just ain't swingin' like it shou-ou-ould

Problems, problems, pro-o-o-o-blems
They're all on account-a my lovin' you like I do-o-o-o-o
Problems, problems, pro-o-o-o-blems
They won't be solved until I'm sure of you-o-ou
You can solve my problems with a love that's tru-you-e

Problems, problems, problems all day long

Problems, problems, problems all day long

Oh no the battle forms inside,
And I speak, but you don't see the signs,
My heart aches, leaving me here to hide,
My world shakes, until you assure me,

Oh no there goes composure,
Over and out to sea,
oh no this won't control me,
But it seems to get the best of me,

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder why...

Oh no I'm crossing my fingers,
In hopes that you will not leave me,
Far away, the silence it burns me,
As I wait, the tension builds,

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder why...

Oh why can't I move forward?
Oh why does my mind wander?
Oh why does my heart desire you?

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder...

The same problem, coming to haunt me again,
And I know it's taken the best of my head,
The same problem tears me to pieces inside,
And I'm left to wonder oh why...

Oh no there goes composure...

You saying that you know
But I really really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boy
So don't be dumb
I got 99 problems
But you won't be one
Like what!

One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds

Pill cool but I prefer my MDMA by the bag
Heavy hitter right here, all you other nigga's jabs
Big talking bout beef till you serve they ass a slab
Do the math hoes clash, cause I got them yelling, "Woo!" like Flair

Now it's 442 my pack a bang rewinding,
My bitches red as highness throw back on them Yokohamas
I'ma slam the scraper, you touch the paper it's go,
We out here grindin' fo sho
These hoes thinking it's snow
I get it goin' my nig', I blow the horn as she ready
Disrespectful nigga please, I'm the one with the fetty

I just show 'em my diamonds nigga 'cause Lane is the game.

Out with the old.
And in with the new.
That's what they say,
Those who don't have a clue.

You're fighting this rain.
You're willing the shine.
You can't help yourself.
But I know you are trying.

When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict

Still chasing a dream
You're facing the facts
The weight of the reel
No more regrets
No looking back
The problem to big
The tower to high
Yes says the heart
But no says the mind

When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict

I wish this world apart
Where I could give you all the answers
But the fight continues on
And the fact of the matter
Is I am convinced we all
Spend far too much time on the fence
Choosing sides
Tell me which is right

You can't deal with the problem on the surface anymore
Go for the root -
And put your boot in the door
Knock down the walls

And get right to the core
Go for the root
Brush off the dust when you find it
Now's the time to explore

Go for the root
It's the conflict between fact and meaning
I'm living proof
And you can't scale the walls

'Cause there's an armed guard on the roof
Go for the root
Just found a crack in the foundations
We'll drill ourselves a way

Right to the root
Brush off the dust when you find it
Now's the time to explore
Go for the root

You can't deal with the problem on the surface anymore
Go for the root
It's the conflict between fact and meaning
I'm living proof

When you watch the starving thousands
On the channel of your choice my friend
You're an audience for war
But you're always switching sides

It's like looking at a landscape
Through a microscope in the middle of the night -
Even half a revolution
Would only bring you light

Go for the root
You're so messed up by politics lady
There's nothing exotic in poverty
Go for the root

Where do you get your information
From a dream or a twenty four inch screen
Brush off the dust when you find it
Now's the time to explore

Go for the root
You can't deal with the problem on the surface anymore
Go for the root

Conflict, confusion, distrust...
Conflict confusion distrust

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Confusion in my head
Don't understand all that you said
And now I see the light
It's times like these I realize
But how can I read these
Mixed messages that you did bring
And forgive all the pain you cause
All of the suffering

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Keep my perspective straight...
Keep me away from hate...
Keep my eyes uncovered...

You taught me right

I feel so deceived

Conflict, confusion, distrust...
Conflict confusion distrust

I feel so deceived!

Looking for an answer to end all the violence
But you'll find no solutions behind the white paper
Searching for a way to break down that fence
Do you really believe in this ludicrous caper?

Mountbatten murdered - a rebel gunman's been shot dead
"They're all murdering bastards" - or was that something that I read?
Well, whatever - it's just the same -death, destruction, violence and pain

This side, that side, that side, this side
What side? Any side. You can't side me
That side, this side, this side, that side
What side? Any side. You can't side me

Where could it end? What could the outcome be?
One thing's for sure there'll be a lot more corpses before the Government can see
A lot more screaming bullets. A lot more children dead
And a lot more 'Bloody Sundays' all painted in red

A lot more pointless talks and a lot more death walks
A whole lot more of whose tribe should rule
The squaddies on the corner. The gunman's on the roof
Who's the real terrorist? Well don't look to the media for your proof

The British Empire ain't what it used to be, mate!
And it's a bit late to try and make it great
So, what's the point in fighting out there?
British Constitution on a land's fate

The 'Vengill' computer sums it all up
It's just packed with reasons to cut people's lives up
Well whatever, it's just the same
Death, destruction, violence and pain

I see no point in deciding
Because I won't fight for troops in Ireland
I won't shoot the IRA dead
And I won't smash no bastard's head
Because I don't want to die
Do you want to die?

This side, that side, that side, this side
Right side, wrong side. Can't side me
This side, that side, that side, this side
What side? Your side. Can't side me

Nowhere to run, to hide
Justice, revenge for their crimes
bloodshed without warning
Now they must all pay the price
The ultimate in justice, reprisal for their crimes
Assassinate, eliminate, the rule of an eye for an eye

The moral question, to take another's life
Political necessity when justice has been denied
Terrorized for crimes that often go untried
Spreading fear throughout their victims, ultimate sacrifice
Criticized for killing any hope for peace
Violence no matter what the consequence

Who pays the price? all for a place that they call home
Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home
This pain, this suffering, in a fight that will never end
Withdraw, to disengage from a place that they call home
Reclaim, retaliate in a fight that will never end

Fighting for a home, the right to claim a land
when victory is everything and nothing will hold back
This is their fight to keep their home
This is their fight to claim their land
This is their fight to keep their culture and their people on the map
Someone must pay for their crimes

Attrition.
Kill their own kind.
Suicide.
Kill their own kind.
Attrition.
Kill their own kind.

And they will fight with everything for victory no matter what the price
They must defeat at any price
And they will fight with everything
Relentlessly, when justice is denied
The choice must be made
Kill. this price must be paid
Kill the choice must be made, kill
This price must be paid, kill
Revenge must be made, kill
For a place that they can call their home
And they will fight with everything until they've reached their goal
The price to pay for a place to call their home
To keep their culture and their people on the map
Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home

Something to prove, something to say
Feeling secure, a false portrait
Forging alone the facts unknown
Hiding the to drag us on

Trapping the standpoint
Local disjoint
More to protect than to reject
Reflect the conflict inside

Punish the core, the more unsure
Testing the strength of us once more
Peeling away the scar to bleed
Peeling again a growing seed

Accept the consequence
Unlike our differences

Shameless and painless
Reflect on conflict

Darkening the senses
Hate pounding on
All emotions conquered
No heart to be found

Nerves fill with fire
Open eyes dialate
Burning deep inside
Weakened bodies fulminate

The forward march
Is crushing life
Firepower
Lights up the night

Rip through the flesh
Searing within
Militant trek
Death only wins

Enemies must die
The only law
To push the line
This is the law

To take life
To crush life
To rule life

[Instrumental]

I want it all no question
Queens terrorism, at his best when I wear my vest and
Desert Eagle, inferred for protection
Interceptin, your collection, when I'm makin' section
Nigga listen, I brake ya ass into submission
Professionalist, specializin' in this
Hennessey wit a twist, another nigga miss
Gone in the abyss, fuckin wit the fish
Scratch him off the list
Automatic trey pound seven in my fist, get ya wig split
Green Eyes rise, Flushing, Queens, 'Lanz Enterprise
Wise got shine, forever brightly
Gats forever held tightly, this fight be (don't take us lightly)

Now stoned be the way Quaz' walk, reppin' New York
For outlinin' criminal bodies wit white chalk
Wildin' these streets, I'm playin' for keeps, avoidin the beast
To keep play the cemetery body, capisce
The hashish, made me unleash, six through his dome piece
And that's just to say the least
But quote for quote, more dough choke throats like inhale smoke
Forever ready like nine volt, batteries
Lost casualties, ricochet through ya anatomy
Another tragedy, wit my family cause catastrophe
From Queens them Kings call me ya majesty
Drama has to be, my hostile days, from outta, puff lies
These high roller somethin', before my shots'll start pumpin'

6-3 Thug, blow a nigga like drought
Some say my lifestyle, need to be change
Scramble and foul, two hundred ten pound
Take nickel plate, who hold the weight now
Leave you hear, bouncin the whip, I'm sippin' Cristal
All thunked out, bent in the streets wit my pistol
My rhyme noters, rippin' ya meat, for beef I hold it down
Fuckin' wit the wrong cat, to many gats black
Phenom never suffer set back, I blast off just like a jet pack
To crack the barrel, Pacino through over dowel
Just get a title, find ya life blazin' in the saddle
Knowin half the battle was just a Queens soldier story
And fuckin wit niggas unless you asset to all for me
Spotted the code, with five seconds to explode
Escape wit the scroll, my family gun ho
Five hundred mellows, crackin serafino
Ropin casinos, but seenin a man, wit gun totin, chico
That organize extortion like the Godfather sequel
To open eyes to all evils that peoples
Mainly maintain to do, shittin' where I'm through
Fuck's not given when I'm rippin through
Who is you? I can see fast and blast past ya faggot attitude

Off top, the Remi had me bent dizzy and shit
Drunk like a Mexican, clap wit ya Fam wit Smith and Wesson's
Rip, heavy wit shine, diamond flexin'
Spot lock for possession, welcome to the real world
Taught 'em why I hate this (We don't a fuck who it is)
Stop the bullshit, I guarantee you get hit, by Psycho Kiz
1996 to the year I quit, nothin happenin'
Fuck the yappin', and start clappin'
All these savages movin' backwards, splittin' they wigs
Smashin 'em, shootin 'em, red rum for everyone
Fuck a key, Queens niggas move in tons
The real number ones, for the chest, ice fish still on the run

My desert needs a high rise, fuckin' wit these wise guys
Can you recognize, Desert Storm, 'Lanz Enterprise
Smile like Einstein, jury drip, guns combine
You don't want mine, gotta fight this all in one time
Plus ya override, bustin straight, you bustin' the sky
I know you scared while I'm lookin' at the devil inside
Rollin dice like my weapon, hold the four and a five
And a cold and hard where I was born from the start
Here to play a part, smokin' weed and sellin' the dark
And watchin out for NARCS, Flush and entourage in charge
And surround the espionage, we all livin' large

How can we achieve anarchy if we don't know what it means?
Do we even want anarchy that illusionistic dream?
They say they see no reason for discontent
In this period of free enterprise, is evolution spent?

Say their progress is insallable, presented indisguised
Decisions made for all is their responsibility?
They forecast better ways to better days; onwards they seek progress no matter what it takes
From left to right to all the prats in the middle

From the judge to the preacher to the sinners and the cynical
From the Godley to the gullible to the vicious and viable
The globe turns slowly while the governed and ungovernable
Slay it out in the never ending search for righteousness, immaculate success

Their space to possess seems to be what makes their clock tick, but to us it fucking stinks
When met with resistance, they stamp on it until it breaks
Their society remains secret and although we know their name
We are the pawns on the world?s chessboard in one big multi-national game

There's still no end in sight but still we know we?re right
We must somehow struggle on up while they go racing to the top
Then Whitehouse "V" the squat, a challenge I think not
Resist every move they make by fulfilling our own hearts

Not by backing off and dropping out, get in there for a start
If you're looking for some proof of this how much more proof do you need
When constantly and hopelessly we fail and they succeed
There's no compassion in here

My fingers keep curling into fists these days
No one smiles on the streets these days
And there's no compassion
Hit the wall a substitute for a face

You can look but you can't touch
You can see but you can't have
Keep crawling to the end of the week
And there's no compassion

Breath heavy to pretend it?s fun
Raise the cover to protect your pride
Ignore the failure that you see in the glass
Paint the flesh to hide the scar

And there's no compassion
A million people died in the middle of your breakfast
A million people died in the middle of your favorite love song
A million people died in the middle of your racist joke

A million people died in the middle of your favorite TV programme
A million people died in the middle of your lovemaking
A million people died in the middle of your pop stars interview
A million people died in the middle of your video game

A million people died in the middle of your sexist
A million people died in the middle of your mass debating
A million people died in the middle of your politicians lying
A million people died in the middle of your silence

A million people died in the middle of your stocks and shares
A million people died in the middle of your royal variety performance
A million people died in the middle of your debutante?s ball
A million people died in the middle of your day out at Ascot

A million people died in the middle of a Conflict gig!
Separation is complete. A mind to domesticate, condition, compete
Clinical birth control, the sterlised setting
Syringed into being, life is just beginning

Mask of the surgeon, eyes of the blind, rubber band caressing, welcome to mankind
The brain perceives the fear, tender beats the heart
Slapped into life programming starts
Wanted and needed

Wanted from birth to fit in the jigsaw puzzle
Trained don't strain against the muzzle
Force-fed, prostituted, brainwashed that's called learning
Blindfolded, prejudiced, an outcome predetermined

Needed to die and not question why
Follow in ignorance, a comfortable prison
Kept in the dark so they can be free. Spit in the eyes so you will never see
The kid aims the cap gun, points it at my cranium

I am supposed to put my hands up, but I don't want to die that way
Mentally or physically, para-psychologically, whose responsibility?
Is it to feed their profiteering tolerated as long as your mind is fearing?
Right where they want you beaten back into submission

Right where they want you in a missionary position
Needed to promote their glory of possession
To accept and be grateful yet ask no questions
To believe in love and their guiding hand

To obey in humility and never understand
I was feeling alright, yeah just me and the night; I was walking through a white tiled subway
I heard the sound of voices around the corner shouting
The sound of broken glass, no one was there

I looked at my reflection in the puddles in the street
It looked so messed up I just kept moving my feet
To the beat and rhythm of my heart, not much I know but I see it as a start
Because I'm counting the heads to see how many are left, the fingers of one hand stretching

And this feeling of apathy keeps coming quite suddenly -
Well if something?s gonna come, when's it coming?
While you're jumping on the spot, all the freshness starts to rot
And another inspiration fades away. And still you sell your dignity

Still you sell your dignity time after time
And I wonder where lies your pride, does it wait in there inside?
Is it waiting for the moment when you let your heart speak?
Is it waiting for the moment when you act out your own beliefs?

Is it waiting for the moment when you drop your false act?
Is it waiting for the moment when you face the facts?
That you're pumping your life for someone else?s ideas
That you're living your life under someone else?s fear

That it's time to shift your vision, time to move your head
Get up out of submission. I'm counting heads, how many are left?
The fingers of one hand keep stretching. The fingers of both hands keep stretching
And all I see is "Rock ?n? Roll". All I hear is "Rock ?n? Roll"

I turn the pages of the book, and force my weary eyes to look
At the product of our modern world, at the product of our civilised world
And a child?s face looks out at me, questioning why does this have to be?
And I can't find any answer, not that dead ears can hear - do I make myself clear?

It's been said that we must progress for humanity, but looking at the truth of that mockery
I wonder if our minds have progressed anywhere, and I wonder if there's any humanity there
The sightless eyes looking at me, questioning why does this have to be
And I can't find any answers not that dead ears can hear - do I make myself clear?

If you're an activist not while getting pissed,
If you're gonna do something make sure you don't miss
That's a dangerous game to play what use are you if you're banged up?
You can't beat them on the streets, so duck and dive a little, hide the fiddles

Play them at their own game, stay with them all the way
Know what and why they are doing things and create alternatives
Police are still snooping, awaiting the big nick
Like fishermen baiting the fish, tempting us to take the risk

This time, this time they've made the impossible.
The new aids infection from EMI the treatment to replace the old spermicide

The poll tax hangs above our heads, as Thatcher wields the axe
The budget, well that pleased us, our shares increased and less tax
The nurses, fight for better pay ILEA closing down
Alton hits out with his bill, the yuppies invade town

The AIDS creation raised its head, their latest weapon to date
USA battles it out in the Gulf to show only they shall reign
The IRA bomb a military base some injured, someone dead
Superpowers discuss Atomic bombs, reductions seem in sight

Thousands join the new clause and march for Lesbian and Gay rights
The TUC, they delegate, another disaster strikes
P & O put their foot down, airport chaos screws the break
Sunshine radiation homes in; down pours more acid rain

See it ain't no pretty picture as we see our world destroyed
Multi-corporation graphs rise up to keep us all employed

The Government say they're succeeding with their democratic state
They say that we all stand as equals
That they genuinely trying, but the bastards are lying
Spewing out their bullshit, simply talking out their arse
The opposition prove yet again that they're just a jumped up farce
Full of socialist Marxist bollocks that just don't make any sense
Barking totally up the wrong tree on the wrong side of the fence

The only change you will see from them is the silver handed back
As you buy their militant paper full of promise and attack
A more apt title would be "servant" for their lapdogs just the same
As the racist shitrag bulldog, politricks the game

Support this, support that you don't know where support is at
It ain't dishing out little leaflets, wearing badges, looking right
They march here, march there, showing all how much they care
Lining someone else's pockets as the bucket comes around again

If you don't vote, then don't complain - oh fuck off!

Don't you realise what you're saying?
You're supporting every move they make
Holding the parliamentary system up, they rise, the powerful elite
There is no independence in party politics

They police the street, they dictate the beat
Her Majesty's institutions make sure the aware retreat
Oh yes, it's a sad sickening picture of human nature going wrong
Plummeting down the depths of degradation, the end, the result of your votes. We stand
Alone... Stop

Start- by organising, putting small pieces together
Soon the bits will fit in place the start of our new picture
Push forward for what you believe in and on achievement dig in hard
Don't let them try and break you, without you they fall apart

Civil rights and natural force will conquer, all and it's right on course
They can only offer chaos when the least we have got is love
We're talking one long tough struggle with many set backs along the path
To freedoms now ahead of us our world will exist at last

Remember, against all odds

We offer you democracy and progress. If you have the capital, we can offer you interest
There is no poverty, this is our reality. We will protect you but only if you invest
The AIDS crisis comes to those who sin,
You question the Gulf situation but the right shall win

Subversive groups are minorities. Will they ever learn and see?
That we're superpowers, we will always sin
Support has grown for the mutant sexual acts. Allow us please to give you some hard facts
We shall not stand for deviancy; it's not the way God meant us to be
Normal people we must push them back

So Listen crowd of people and listen wisely, it's I, daddy Kerry, telling everybody
So what we gonna do about this mad lady?
Everybody knows she's gonna mash up the country
We must be patient in our struggle for freedom

The state shall make it's own mistake, don't feed them ammunition
Time is not running out, time be with us on our side
Maintain the resistance; see the end of apartheid
We're living in a Government style. No time for no fuss and fight, everybody must unite.

We must abolish apartheid
Brothers and sisters fear no more! Rise up and face this evil oppression
Sigh and cry no more, for one day, that fine day
The huge cloud that overshadows all. Shall lift, rise high, all say - forward

Don't shake the hands of the firing squad. There are no tokens here
Remember those burning eyes, them hungry bellies. No cure can exist in promises
Medicine cures all, but when cancer spreads, there can be no cure
Meanwhile brothers crawl on the death pile to die. The result of western world economics

Meanwhile the bullet rips the flesh of the young mother.
The flies feast on the eyes of the young child
Meanwhile - hey cool guy McDonald's man, eating the flesh of the fellow man
Wise up, sucking up to the good life. The Coca-Cola formula continues to run red

Rising high on the graph of oppression
Public outcry exists worldwide. Headstones still commemorate the many who have died
Coffins laid to earth. Resistance dead. Rowntree Mackintosh machine guns rise instead
Crucify jah children; suffer once again they shall

In honor, they retaliate. Stones against tanks, inevitably the innocent die
The bodies laying deep are your responsibility
How can sister from outside nation march in disgust at apartheid, whilst using dictator bankbook?
Finance fuels all and in retrospect, it offers nothing more than misery

Political leaders stand off, offering the false hand of opinion poll support
Political factions offer nothing more than violence
Ignorance breeds arrogance, arrogance creates violence. And that is their solution
The abysmal result of dictatorship. Their excuses for slavery

The chain around our necks. The guns in the street
don't consider violence as an alternative
Until you've picked up bits of your relatives in the street
Until you've felt the whip crack tear the skin. The gas burns the eyes

The baton on the skull. The torture in prison
Use sanctions and the grey cloud will disperse
The constitution known as apartheid and it?s ilk will be destroyed
And our world shall exist

Brothers and sisters
Such things cannot be bought and sold
Such things cannot be arranged by Governments
Such things cannot evolve overnight. These things take time
These things take time

When I'm lost
Can't find my way
You're the light that leads to harbor

When I'm crushed can't find my strength
You are all elements of life
Giving me skin so warm so tender
Giving me deep a sense of believe

All I know, all there is
A reflection of you
A home to this body of conflict

Deep into my love
Deep into my heart
Deep into surrender

When I'm blocked
Can't find my words
You're the lines
Making a sentence
When I'm hurt
Can't find the sense
You're the sun
That heals all sorrow
All I know, all there is
A reflection of you
A home to this body of conflict

Deep into my love
Deep into my heart
Deep into surrender

This is mankind and mankind kills
You think that women are just here for thrills
Your filthy morals just fucking stink
Don't try and get my hands in your sink
Don't call me your "bird"; I'm not your pet
Well, I've had enough, right up to my neck

This is mankind and mankind kills
Why should women be raped at your will?
This is mankind and mankind kills
Why should women pay for man's thrills?

Why don't you get married?
Wear that wedding ring?
Can't she see it's the only respectable thing?
She'll cook his meals
Sleep in his bed
Do anything he says

If only I had known you better.
If only you weren't afraid to try.
You and me, we'd make a bad, bad team.
But we'll never understand the reasons why.

If only you.
If only me.
If only you.
If only me.

I remember the day that I met you.
The politics were already strong.
I think you knew, like me, that it would never work out.
And I'm surprised that it even lasted so long.

If only you.
If only me.
If only you.
If only me.

If only light didn't come in the morning.
If only darkness didn't fall at night.
If only you and me had led different lives, baby.
I know that eveything would have turned out alright.

If only you.
If only me.
If only you.
If only me.

You've got to believe there's something inside of me
That makes me feel this way
You've got to believe that you're still a part of me
Today

But telling a tale cannot be like living it
No matter what you say
And talking of love cannot be like giving it
Away

I know
And you know
The voices are calling
Now that I have you

Whatever in the world can I do
Now that I have you
Whoever in the world could say it's not true
Now that I have you

I wonder how much of our life is memory
Remember yesterday
I'm hoping to God you don't believe everything
I say

Remebering every part of our history
A year is like a day
You've got to believe that things won't always be
This way

I know
And you know
The voices are calling
The walls are falling
For my love
And your love
I've got to keep stalling
Now that I have you

Whatever in the world can I do
Now that I have you
Whoever in the world could say it's untrue
Now that I have you

Well, there's a hot wind blowing tonight in the east,
And I heard that the park is filled tonight with police.
On the radio there's nothing but a man saying
To stay inside.
Well, I remember what you said on the telephone,
That you didn't feel like it was safe to stay alone.
And you would get yourself to me if you could find
A way across the line.

But there's fire tonight on your side of town,
Orange light in the sky without a sound.
Fire tonight on your side of town.
I watch and wait for you to come around.

Well, there's a faint sound of sirens tonight in the air,
And I heard that the downtown streets tonight are bare.
On the TV here they're telling me the roads are all
Closed down.
You said that if you couldn't take the car you'd walk
Instead.
It was the last thing you said before the line went dead.
And now I'm waiting by the window holding all the things
Of yours I've found.

But there's fire tonight on your side of town,
Orange light in the sky without a sound.
Fire tonight on your side of town.
I watch and wait for you to come around.

I know we always said that we were free.
I know we never thought this would succeed.
But now your face is all that I can see.

But there's fire tonight on your side of town,
Orange light in the sky without a sound.
Fire tonight on your side of town.
I watch and wait for you to come around.

Here are a few notes from the underground.
Load them at your pleasure.
These are the dusty pictures that I found
While on my search for treasure.

Here is the hazy vision that I saw,
For a scientist I am too raw
I know all about you can't you see?

She said don't be making no provocation
Unless you're ready to handle the nation
I'm cold and I'm bold and I don't do what I'm told.

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

Remember as you bust north at her call,
That you can never doubt it.
No matter what you cannot have it all,
'cause she leaves home without it.

But in the darkness where we both were caught,
In the heartbeat of El Nido.
I had a vhs for her to slot
And now I never want to go.

She said "Now you're here, you've got to show and prove,
And do that dance until it don't move.
The phone doesn't work so you won't be calling home."

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

She was so absolutely digital,
To jack in now was wrong.
But Cupid punches deck with chemicals
While Dark Madonna sings her song.

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

Mirrorshades.

He got a sheath made of plastic
Grabs it over his head
Forty gallons of petrol
Gonna burn you all dead

A forty-five strapped to his side
A machete in his hand
What's the name what's the game
Holy hack jack's the man

He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
He hobbles along on a busted knee
Knife strapped to his thigh
Bombs and blades, hand grenades
Somebody's gonna die

With his cassocks an' his robes and his leather chaps
Covered by a plastic mack
He's sick he's insane
Holy hack jack's at it again
Sick sick, sick sick

Clapped out buggy down darkened streets
Likes to kill whoever he meets
He's sick he's insane
Holy hack jack's at it again
Sick sick, sick sick

He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
He's a sick sick, sick gone mother
He's a sick sick, sick gone man
Sick sick, sick sick

The worms crawl in and the worms crawl out
The ones that crawl in are lean and thin
The ones that crawl out are fat and stout
Your eyes fall in and your teeth fall out
Your brains come tumbling down your snout

Be merry my friends
Be merry

You don't know how it feels to be Me
To be sitting on the edge dangling my feet
Wondering if god would give his angels charge
If I was feeling small
If my mind was growing large

I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head

You don't know how it feels to be Me
Having all these faces looking in to see
Their eyes are white lit just like a torch
To burn my soul which is thin and which is worn

I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head

Take my life
Take my life
Take my life
Before I taken it myself

You don't know how it feels to be me
To be a poet nailed to this tree
Where are my accusers those who ridicule
Those who have learned to hate and curse this silly fool

I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head
I am the worm crawling through your head

I know headaches are always
Someplace on my mind

But your drug
Just make it worse, love
Little pains are just fine

Sometimes, medicine works well
Chemicals help out, for sure

But your drug
Just make it worse, love
The treatment's worse than the cure

But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned

As long as the sun's in the heavens
The worm stays underground
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned

All bonds that God ties
Man is master to tear apart
All crop on God's made land
Man is master to sow and reap
All deaths worms die
Man is master to engineer
And the bliss of freedom glimmers like gold
Empty the cast, melt the mold

The worms of God

We've torn away Your spear God
This is sacrament to show it
It's the bread of liberation
And the wine of celebration
In the gloom of gluttony, lust takes its toll
Its hold is stronger than of the Gods of old

The worms of God

Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far

Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me you'd stop and see
How beautiful they are

Inch worm, inch worm

Life sucks
And death is calling
Every day

I keep my chin up
But my spirit's falling
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

Last night
Won't see the morning
Every day
I see the sunset as an endless warning
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

Knife cuts
Through all that I wanted
Every day

It's like living in a
House that's haunted
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

...and all is well in our world

He wears his heart
Safety pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers
Whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of whats inside
To save his life he crawls
Like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird

Out of his mind away
Pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
Maybe out of his mind

All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of whats inside
To save his life he
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm from a bird

All he knows
If he can't relieve it it grows
And so it goes
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from the bird

Out of his mind away
Pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind

All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of whats inside
To save his life
He crawls like a worm from a bird
All alone he
Holding his breath half to death
Terrified to save his life
He crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm from a bird
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

Worms don't dance they haven't got the balls
No matter how do you do
It's just you do that's all
You got what it takes to knock at my door
You wanna get all excited
Never been here before

And now I'm your apple eating heathen
The original sin
Well you ain't got my faith
So best keep your belief
I had waited forever to love someone
I swear I heard you thank your god this time
For having me come along

Chickens don't fly but they have got the wings
No matter how hard they try
They bump into things
They're all running around
Like they're heads on the ground
They got a wish bone where their backbone should've grown

And now I'm your apple eating heathen
Any old rib stealing eve
Well you don't have my faith
So best keep your belief
I had waited forever to love someone
I swear I heard you thank your god that time
For having me come along

Intimacy reduced to cruelty
Had you believe like this was meant to be
And I look for the magic
But you got away with it
That's all

Everyday I reach down into the dirt
Hoping to find me a little nugget of gold
But all I got is some worms
Everyday I pull green slime down to my heart
Grab it with both hands and hold until my lungs burn
I think tragedy sleeps at the foot of my bed
Its incessant breathing keeps me awake
Every time I wake up it takes me at least 10 minutes to remember my name
And sometimes I get it wrong
Every time I reach out into the world hoping to find a kindred soul I get burned
Burn it down
I've been searching for a reason I've been living for the season
Give me something to believe in
Burn it down

Crack! What the feins use to get high
And the hustlers move to get by that's why the song called crack!

I got the cops drawn, I put the block on
Over rare 'bout to stock piles of the popcorn
Feins got the block warm getting they cop on
My young'ns run the block till ev'ry one of the rocks gone
And I got another block I'm puttin' the pot on
Strong enough to smell through the jar wit the top on
Cop and be gone, if you come to the block drawn
I'll hit you with the glock till ev'ry one of the shots gone
He thought he was a thug he was all on his pop join'
Till he got popped now he all on his rock join'
I left him all on the block wit his top gone
Law called his mom and pop they all on they shock join'
I was just tryna make some bread for my family
And ev'rybody got somebody dead in they family
And ev'rybody got some crackheads in they family
So it's no room to hate cause I kno you relate, my shit

Crack! Crack! Crack!
Its called crack!
I said crack!
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!

Falling around in a fog of a mountain
It took me away
And now ill never go back
Always believed you
But never could see you
You seemed to disappear when
Everything went black
You turn around one minute
And they've taken everything you have

Look at the night the skies the seas
The trees the cracks running up the wall
Think of the start the end the screams
The dreams the thing underneath it all

Day, it is ending no calling no sending its harder to remember just who you are
Waiting for someone to come follow you into the dark

Where did it go? storm of love.
Thunder of flesh, hurricane of blood.
Hail of sweat. the cleansing rain
Used to come lick their pain.
Fingers search the private space.
Promise fills your face.
Treasure chest, beautiful back,
Kiss every crack.
Sit around the fame.
Crack
Slowly I became.
Crack
I'll do it, I'll do
Anything you tell me to.
Stick it on or stick it through.
Anything you want me to.
Any ship, put through
Any port I'm coming to
Anything you tell me to...
Where did it go? storm of love.
Thunder of flesh, hurricane of blood.
Hail of sweat. the cleansing rain
Used to come lick their pain.
Sit around the fame.
Crack
Slowly I became.
Crack
Fingers search the private space.
Promise fills your face.
Treasure chest, beautiful back,
Kiss, kiss every crack.
Kiss, kiss every crack.

Get no regard for no br'noad
Peel'noff my car, bitch I'm from Collipi'nark
Southside, outside, and I'm ridin' round, I get it
And I look around, they took my style
Like mothafucka you trippin'
Let me slow it down 'fore I get a ticket
Nigga want a verse from me, it's gon' cost a chicken
Rev your mirror, shake it like a stipper ho!
Car so big it got a stripper pole

All I talk is crack, I can get the Ricoh

[Chorus]

And you need to mind your fucking bi'naz
Get cash, get fat this will pay for tonight
New car, you are not me forget it!
I got more hoes than four hoes
I had a foursome for Christmas!
Let me turn it down my baby mama listening
Extra garlic butter I got benihana issues
Trigga finger itchin' like it's poison ivy
Going so hard Viagra trying to sign me
I might get an endorsement from baking soda
Catch me cooking crack trying to make a Rollie!

[Chorus]

Crack

All I talk is crack, I can get the Ricoh!

Don't stop singing; it's a beautiful sound
I'll get the drinks in before we hit the ground
And I don't know who'll speak first
It doesn't matter anyway tonight
Let's be best strangers
They closed the bar an hour ago
Last train whistles down the track
But I see something growing up from the cracks

I'll show you my heart if you'll show me yours
Were you wild and unique babe or just par for the course?
What have we got to lose, anyway?
From one drunk to another think what I'm trying to say
Some mirrors have been broken
And some things pull you back
But I see something growing up from the cracks

We've both seen the thunder that's coming in low
And each day tries to run you right off the road
But if you listen out for the sound
We'll get a thousand hooves drumming in this one horse town, and
The lights are out on the west side
They paint the sky in black
I swear I see something shining up from the crack

And they closed this bar an hour ago
Last train whistles down the track
But I see something growing up from the crack

I thought you'd listen to my reason
But now I see you don't hear a thing
Got to make you see how it's got to be
Yes if it's all right

All or nothing yeah yeah
All or nothing
All or nothing for me

Things could work out just like I want them to
If I could have the other half of you
That's all I would if I only could
Is to say

All or nothing oh yeah
All or nothing if I could I'd say
All or nothing for me

Pa pa pa pa ta pa pa pa ta ta
Pa pa pa pa ta pa pa pa ta ta

I ain't telling you no lie girl
So don't just sit there and cry girl
All or nothing (oh no)
All or nothing (oh yeah)
All or nothing (gotta gotta gotta keep on tryin')
All or nothing
(For me, for me, for me we're not children)

I she'd my skin
When the party was about to begin
I'm light years away but
I'm walking back, tonight,
Of all nights
When I should be feeling just right
Don't want to be in public,
My head is full of chopstick I don't like it.

Something on my mind..
Breaking open doors I sealed up before,
Something on my mind..
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far.


Somebody shaking my tree
Maybe that somebody is me
I'm standing in the light but I'm making a break for
The shadows on the cinema wall.
They should be mine but I'm not that tall
Now I'm saying this in private
If I had a car,
I'd drive it insane

(chorus) (chorus)


I'm looking for cracks in the pavement...

(chorus) (chorus) (chorus)

Got into a cab, Broadway, Fifty Ninth
 Took off like a blast
Almost lost my mind - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack

It first felt like at thrill ride
Excited for a while
Got pretty scary
Swerving at a hundred miles an hour - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack
I want to get out,
out of this yellow shell
I want to get out,
crack cabbies straight from hell

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack

Cabbies on crack
Want my money back
Disco blasting out,
Stomach in my mouth - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack

Times Square was approaching
He braked for the light
At 90 miles an hour,
flashed by, I saw my life - oh, oh, oh

Cabbies on crack
I want to get out,
out of this yellow shell
I want to get out,
crack cabbies straight from hell

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack

Cabbies on crack

We've had enough of you
And your do as we say not as we do
Where the hell do you get off
Thinking your better than us
Who are you to make the rules
The same rules you always abuse
Your someone we'll never trust
We'll respect you when you respect us

We will thrive while were alive
Nobody's going to bring us down
We'll bend but never break
You can't take us
You can't make us quit
Never falter Never Fail
We've got the will to fight
The future is ours to take
You can't break us
You can't make us

Cracks in this armor hard to find
Search all you want but your wasting your time
No weak link No Achilles heel
Just a burn we'll make you feel
Formed from ire and angst
A deep resentment coming of age
Don't look now but here it comes
The revolution has now begun

There is nothing you can say or do
We'll anticipate your every move
You can do or you can die just stay out of the way
If you must try to fuck with us than you know this now
We will make you pay

OK, kick me in the head
Just cause something that I said
You don't want to know the truth
Cause you're wild and full of youth

Was it something that I said
Something that I said
Something in my head?

You ain't got no friends no more
Cause you kicked them to the floor
Time will tell, and you will see
That it's down to you, not me

Was it something that I said
Something that I said
Something in my head?

OK, now you're on your own
Your self-righteousness has grown
So get off your pedestal
Before you ain't got no friends no more

Was it something that I said
Something that I said
Something in my head?

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the
Gonna lock us up in a, home
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Am and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman
Ta being a president look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music you make when you round that
Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?

That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music

Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it

Oh come all you children
Don't grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman

Don't whore your little bodies
To the worms of paradise
Like Everest, it's fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice

They're riding on the subways
They're riding on the streets
They'll ride you down to the gutters
They'll ride you off your feet

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

Yeah, piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and Coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
The pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
And they'll ride you down to Hell

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth, it sticks like glue

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire

To take your little body
And throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

I'm riding on the subway
The subway down to Hell
I've finished with this journey
Now, I seem to know it well

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock

You're shuckin' and jivin'
Stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock crack rock crack rock

Crooked cop dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot
300 men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the sound

Don't no one hear the rounds, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high

Crack rock
Crack rock
Crack rock
How you feeling girl
How's the gutter doing
Crack rock

By and by, you knew that you make me cry. (By and by, knew you'd make me cry)
And my love for you will never die. (My love will never, never die)
But I had to find out on my own.

(Check yourself, check yourself)

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I paid no mind. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself)
All down the line. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Sometimes you just got to lose.
That's when you pay your dues.
I guess I was a fool, I guess I was a fool,
To think that... you'd stayed so true.

Aww, I really played in the game. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'd always win. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Now the tables turn. (Check yourself, check yourself)
And I'm on the losing end. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Oh don't, feel sorry.
I had it coming, it's true.
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you.

Before I go, I'd like for you to know.
You've had my heart from the very start.
But there's one more thing, before we part.
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart.

Aww, I'm on my sad way. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Because I know I'd lost your love. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'll kick it, like a pass. (Check yourself, check yourself)

But I'll be thinking of....
The good times. (The good times)
The bad times. (The bad times)
But good or bad, happy or sad,
Of memories. (Memories)
Sweet, sweet memories. (Memories)
Aww, memories... are all I have.

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they... what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)

I know I'm sick and my addiction got me itchin'
Everyday I need a fixin'
I ain't quittin' till it kill me
Ya hear me, I like the feel but hate the taste of the product
Like the numb on ya' tongue when you taste narcotics
The bass gets to bumpin'
You can feel what I'm drummin'
Death is comin', I'm tryna warn 'em
That's why I was summoned
I know that they don't want it, they want what they can't have
Euphoria come and go and it's something you can't grab
Still, we're grasping for the emptiness, hoping we can catch something
Hand full of scars, cuts, burns, and some flesh wounds
Verge of insanity, stop me 'for I'm gone
Yeah, I say I'm gon' quit but I'm back at it in the morn'
It goes on and on and on and now I'm used to it
It's a lifestyle now and I don't know what else to do
Got a war inside my soul and it's wantin' to break through
I'm ready for Rehab, jus' do what ya gon' do, Yea

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab

(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab

Tell me what you're gonna do
I know that you know that I'm on
To you
I see your game and I see
The way
With my self esteem you love
To play
When I'm feeling fine things
Go alright
You're sure to be right by
My side
But when I'm down I look around
You're nowhere to be found
Here they come again
Will this ever end
Around till I need them
My plastic friends
They melt when heat begins
They're walking mannequins
My plastic friends
I wonder if you'll ever see
Exactly what you've done to me
I feel alone I've been attacked
And you put the knife into
My back
What I need is honesty
Open exchange from you to me
I've come to you my
Pride aside
So we can make this right
Three times denied I've
Relied too long on visions
Capsules of elastic
Mental prisons
Relating to the masses
For thirty pieces
Candy coated personality thin
Like reece's
Synthetic figments artificial
Pigments
[pathetic] ingesting poisons
Of facades
Illusions on a mountain high
Like Colorado
Bravado London bridges they
Be falling
Value of fools gold with
Kisses manifested
Break, smash, shatter
Counterfeit flatter
Imitation of a friend 'cause
The heat makes you scatter
Blending, comprehending but
Still deceiving
Aimless inventions creations
Spiritual manipulations
I'm running out of patience
Fascinated in your attempts
At being plastic
Spastic, kind of drastic my
Companion you are not

In this world of make believe
My eyes see what I want to see
I'm blinded with the simple lies
So easily I justify

The sin that comes so naturally
Is this all that I'll ever be
Bring this madness to an end
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride
I think I've had enough

Spinning 'round, up and down
But I know it's alright
Move ahead, falling back
Try to leave it behind

Seems I've been here before
So familiar I can tell
Need your help to get off
Of my sin carousel

It's suffice to say I move
Because of your great fortitude
So unstable are my feet
They love to make a fool of me

Afraid to fall I feel corrupt
And as I drop, you pick me up
Take me were I've never been
Don't let this cycle start again

It's got me spinning 'round
And I can hardly tell
Which way is up or down
On my sin carousel

It's got me out of control
And I want to jump off
Somebody stop this ride

Pullin' down strongholds
Pullin' down strongholds

Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires
Pullin' down strongholds, labeled as carnal desires
You got me crazy crossin' up my wires

I got my feet dirty 'cause I'm splashing in the puddles
Got me crazy no room for rebuttals
I let down my guard like doug I got lazy
Hazy vision blurry in a hurry for immoral satisfaction

My heated passion desires, I shoulda put out the fires
That smolder in my mind, time after time, time after time
Will you help me God to just find my own way

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Actual facts keep the theories intact
Mental premonitions speaking flesh to rest
I will not go, I will not bow
Shapes and silhouettes making things complex

Unleashing chemicals give my body a sign
A loss of control leads to moral regret
Seduction, repercussion where I must defend
Entering in the trinity within to fight sin

Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin', got me crazy tryin'
Got me crazy tryin' 'cause I'm

Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen to you
As a result of making these rebellations?

Inventive measures taken I feel my defenses breaking
Independent of all wisdom, secondary senses shaken
In time I arrive battered, beaten and scarred
Sensitivity charred from character barred

So hard to say goodbye to yesterday's dreamin'
Still pullin' weeds from seeds of yesterday's schemin'
Elusive representation of putting mercy to test
Confessed in midnight sessions of my desires suppressed

Entangled similes I've been meaning to comprehend
Conformed by the ways wearing dark shades
Covering up my vulnerability
You can see, I can see this lust is tempting me
To break the chains to avoid devastation, I pray for strength daily

You got me crazy crossin' up my wires

Co-existing remedial rhymes
 with verbal signs
Disseminating inner visions
 to contrive
Broken pieces cobblestones
 they pull me down
Redirection for protection
 confessing
Animosity when your voice
 grows faint
Submission at your feet they
 feel the stings of complaint
Doing what it takes I'm
 taking table crumbs
Dependence on the one
 popularity is done
Expedient the main
 ingredient as I grasp
For the hands of providence
 to circumvent attacks
From the enemy though they
 come against me
Will I listen to your voice
 to infinity
Speak to me 'cause I long for
 your grace
Show me things as I seek
 your face
Here I am I'll do anything
Say want you want from me
A contradiction in my
 directions got me guessing
Do you listen? not to
 mention my phones off the
 hook look
I took control of
 my own path disregarded
 your wrath
Stinky like a day without a
 bath but
Internal convictions oppose
 my addictions
To inventions less eternal
 paternal
Affection from elevated places
 smiling faces
Whisper love in aimless spaces
I hear your voice won't you
 let me follow
Knees bent so we can shoot
 the breeze signs I
 can swallow
Keep the lines open like
 fiber optic hot like
 the tropic
If your driving this train
 let me hop it
Say what you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you speak to me
Wha do you want from me
I'll give you everything
To you my life I bring
Oh won't you
 speak to me

Take time, what's on your mind?
Everybody's standing on another side
It's a chance for personal gain
If you're gonna play on someone else's shame

Take time, share another life
Perfect to the end and taking on our strife
Take the time to clear up your mind
Put away yourself and open up your eyes

This time, I started waiting for myself to fade
Walking in to complications and I rearrange
Do I fear my feelings, am I numb to pain?
Are my senses washing me sane, will it ever go away?

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading

So come on it's about time
Love is so blind, you're walking on the line
Set your mind on ease, take a turn for me please
Would you please?

If you sit back, look at your life
Look at yourself and set back your pride
Take the time for what's on your mind
Put away yourself and open up your life

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
Coming to my senses
Hey, hey, hey, time is fading
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing
My life is changing

My life is changing
My life is changing

Today I want to get away
I want to go some place where I can pray and
Go where the trees are tall
Where the water rushes to the falls

Fly, I want to fly away to a place where they can't find me
I, I want to see the stars that shine and I'll land on mars
And run, I want to run all day far away where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter place

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do

Today I want to get away
Where the skies are clear most every day
I'll go where the river runs
Washes away my field of pain

Fly, I want to fly up high let my spirit soar I'll kiss the sky
I want to go to the place where I find you
Run, I want to run all day to a place where I can face the sun
I want to catch the rays fade away to a brighter day

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away where I can feel you move me
To lose myself in you, I'll do what I have to do
Take me away where I can feel you move me
I'm following close behind, I want to walk in your light

Take me away

An urgent sense of regret and now I'm caught in the zone
My mind arrested by fear and so I go it alone
A metamorphosis conceived by the early light
Distraction of self comes out in the night

Fabricated, I'm constructed of opinions and lies
Which only leads to failing in my own eyes
Sinking to the depths while I'm masking what's inside
A bittersweet existence and I cause my own demise

And I wonder if you've ever seen life through
The eyes of one who understands what it mean
To be free, freedom comes when you can let it go
But I guess you wouldn't know

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Mind reflects the meaning to things that are jumbled
Resting on the first, making time to rehearse
Intricate persona, controlled animation
Visually impaired, clinging to pain immersed

Mentally scarred, cosmetics dripping down
Life in forward motion, exist in reverse
Instable at the seams, trying to conform
Trapped in a maze while sin is at its worst

And I wonder what your gonna do, when your
Disguise comes crashing down and yourself
Comes shining through, are you gonna hide your face?
Or let it rest in the hands of grace, grace

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade
Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade

Dimensions of intervention
Are needless so I think
Striving and thriving I see
I'm driving to the brink

Avoiding annoying eternal
Complications destinations
Unimportant constantly
Distorting my relations

From patience to thoughts of
Hating anyone in my mind
I find it hard to believe you
Can relate to my kind

And if I could I would
Pretend that I'm alright by myself
If you love me as I am I'll
Put my pride on the shelf

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
Skepticism leaves a wrinkle on my brow
Cynicism prevents my change
With this suspicion I'm caught in a dilemma

Intervention with my psyche?
Rearrange walls built to hinder
The intrusion
Preservation of my mental well being

Doubt makes me value the
Safety of my distance
Can it be stubbornness to
Which I cling?

If I can I'll pretend I'm
Alright all by myself
I'd rather drown than take
Your hand

It's the way I am
And if I climb a wall of pride
Swim across my sea of doubt
Will you love me as I am, the way I am

I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose its like forgetting,
Losing who you are,
And at the same time,
Something makes you whole,
Its like that there's a music,
Playing in your ear,
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry,
It's a bit like being scared,
Confused and all mixed up,
And mad as hell,
It's like when you've been crying,
And you're empty, and you're full,
I don't know what it is,
It's hard to tell,

Its like that there's some music,
Playing in your ear,
But the music,
Is impossible,
Impossible to hear,

But then I feel it move me,
Like a burning deep inside,
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

Then suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh oh whoa.
I'm free.

You'll see me sometimes
Making crazy pictures out of music and rhymes
Costume changes perform with poise
Dancing in formation with a couple of boys
I take them on the road with my reel-to-reels
I'm an artist honey
You know how that feels?
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects

It's about wonder
The power to be like thunder

The Minus is loveless
He talks to the land
And the leaves fall
And the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, Plus
She don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

The masking tape tangles
It's sticky and black
And the copper
Proud headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges
That don't get charged back
Well the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy
And she holds out her flashlight
And she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her
What the trouble might be
Well I'm learning
It's peaceful
With a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown
Of this century
They're not going to fix it up
Too easy

We once loved-together
And we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded
And the sparks started flying
And the loose wires
Were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up
Too easy
But she holds out her candle
And she shines it in
And she begs him to show her
How to fix it again
While the song that he sang her
To soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits
Like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

I'm burning through
When I am near you
I feel such a rush
Need it so much from you
And now,
I'm so isolated cause,
You give me it all
Then take it I fall
Without you

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

And now, I'm so isolated cause
I'm sick with no touch
I miss so much
Can't be with you now
It's much too much
Without you
Without you

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

I'm running here
Every focus is splintered
Every attempt he can afford
Rendered pointless and it's streaming down
Senses together they move cleaner than transit will allow
And sometimes I want to move cleaner than transit will allow to be

Electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity

Now in between
Leaving and arriving
I can try to digest this sequence of events
Again I draw it out
And again I get delayed reaction
I get splinters
I watch the people and their cars
It's slow motion
They're beautiful like breaking glass
Not yet broken
My motion is silver on the point
Of a moment, splinter, moment
My vision, the colour of

Electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity

Moment, splinter, moment
Splinter into colour
And let me be

Electricity
Electricity

Singin through you to me
Thunderbolts caught easily
Shouts the truth peacefully
Electricity

High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow deed
Go into bright find the light and know that friends don't mind just how you grow

Midnight cowboy stained in black reads dark roads without a map
To free selectricity (repeat) (Repeat both lines)

Lighthouse beacon straight ahead straight ahead across black seas to bring
Seeking electricity

High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow-deed hide their shadow-deed (repeat)
Seek electricity
Electricity

This song started as a rant against haters
But that'd be giving in to the instigators
If there is one thing I'd like to pull off
When someone steps with hate, all I do is scoff
You can't burn me, you can't burn me

[Chorus]
The same force that flows through every circuit
The juice that's spent every time you work it
Every life form is based on this simplicity
The soul that you have is electricity
You can't avoid that
Evolution is fact
We're all from the same Lucy
Despite differences you see

I'm in disbelief at what people will believe
All along, I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve
If one thing I can say as a piece of advice
Don't believe it till you see it, and then see it twice
It's so funny, it's so funny

[Chorus]

A call out for unity
In every province and city
What do you think we've been saying
Since we first started playing

Freezing Fridays fleeing from me
I've seen you around, I don't know what you think of me
The colors in the air never scared you like they should
I saw it in your face so I told you and you understood

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

Sustained means some Sunday so are we
People speak all week, I just forgot what they told me
The stories in your hair that you carry are it for me
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to lay in it

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

The stories in your hair I've been carrying all around
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna hear 'em now
The stories in your hair I've been carrying all around
Well I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna tear it out

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna stay at your side on a weekday
I wanna see inside your eyes on a weekend

I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travelers to go?

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there, then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly

We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give

We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night i get a call and i know that you're well
And days i was down you would help me get out of my hole

Ohh
Let's be friends
Let's be friends
Let's be friends

You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair

We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

And I can be proud that I'm his girl
'Cause I know that I'm good all by myself
See I don't need his love
I really want him, right

And he can feel good that he's my guy
'Cause he knows
It don't mean that he's just mine
I don't wanna own him, or control him
I just want our souls to be aligned

So,
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
He picked up for a walk around,
He's gonna put that down again

I'm the one he loves & trusts
He goes out on the town
I don't get jealous
It's all about affection
Not possession with us

And I do exactly what I want
When I'm with him,
And when I'm not
It's not a maneuvering
Just to deal with
What we've got

So, If you love someone
Let them be free
I know I don't want no one suffocating me.

Don't settle for ownership
Make it deep
If you love some one
You should feel good
To let them breathe

So,
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around
I'm his
When you see me walking around
I'm his
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

A friend is someone you like to be with
A friend is someone who likes to be with you
And big or small, short or tall
It don't matter at all to a friend

A friend is someone who stands beside you
When others are treating you mean
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And are you a friend?
Do you think you'd make a good one?
'Cause you've got to be fair
And show them you care
'Cause a best friend is someone who knows how to share

A friend is someone who makes you happy
A friend is someone you make happy too
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And are you a friend?
Do you think you'd make a good one?
'Cause you've got to be fair
And show them you care
'Cause a best friend is someone who knows how to share

A friend is someone who makes you happy
A friend is someone you make happy too
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And big or small, short or tall
It don't matter at all to a friend

I likes to eat my friends and make no bones about it
I likes to eat my friends, I couldn't do without it
Ain't a man or poet, friend, I know just how you'll taste
Your limbs go sliding down my throat and never go to waste

Your death, of course, will sadden me, until I drop your essence
I know your life was not in vain when digestion is commencing
Consider this a celebration and the deepest pact of friends
And I hope that you will dine on me when I come to an end

(Friends, friends)
Even friends may come to you with a new found revelation
But think of it as life renewed and not their termination
"To know you is to eat you" should be the code of lovers
Death brings the highest act of love preserved for one another

(Friends, friends)
People say that what you are is only what you eat
And my friends become a part of me, it's then that life's complete
To know you is to eat you, the act of love supreme
Each one of us inside himself can appetize the dream

(Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends)

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

Sometimes, there's no one to talk to
No one else I can find
But He's always there, He's everywhere
I'm talkin' 'bout a friend of mine

Problems seem like they never end
You have no one to turn to
But you can lean on Him
He'll never let you fall and
All you got to do is call Him
He's just a friend

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

It seems so crazy
You see times have changed and
People say they treat you so good
But then they smile in your face and
They talk behind your back
They're not like the friends of old

But I found a friend who's love is true
It won't change no matter what happens
He's gonna be right there
And you can depend on Him

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

And if you ever need a friend
He's always by your side

And He'll never, ever let you down
He's a friend of mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Yes He is

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your jobs a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,
Or even your year
But

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

You're still in bed at ten
And work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast
So far
Things are goin' great

Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought
You down to your knees and

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Since you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the mess with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst I'm best with you, yeah

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,
Or even your year

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to fall
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

Packing up the dreams God planted
In the fertile soil of you
Can't believe the hopes He's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through

It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

With the faith and love God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show
But we'll keep you close as always

To live as friends
No, a lifetime's not too long

I dreamt of a move
A great move
To another place with much more land
I was driven by car
And woke before I got there
I remember the place and it was beautiful

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.
As friends we were always so close but so far away...
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend?
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for.

There was more for me
It would be more open
Scary to think that I could be happy
She'd said it was the same road
But up more, a lot more
Just be patient and we'll get there

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.
As friends we were always so close but so far away...
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend?
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for.

I never got there
But the morning brings light
And so, I'll keep on looking.

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.

Trying to figure out where and when
We been moving down that same line
Time is now maybe we could get skin to skin

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slippin' a-way
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

I know we're different you and me
Got a different way of walkin'
The time has come to let the past be history
Yeah if we could just start talkin'

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good things got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good things got a way of slippin'
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

Do, do do doo do do do doo
Do, do do doo do do do do doo
Do, do do doo do do do doo
Let's be friends
Do, do do doo do do do doo
Do, do do doo do do do doo
Let's be friends

There's a lot of talk going 'round you
Let them talk you know you're the only one
There's a lot of walls need tearing down
Together we could take them down one by one

Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of comin' to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slippin'
Let's be friends, baby let's be friends

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends

When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

*Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends
 Ones we can depend on
 Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends
 Before we go any further, let's be
 Friends*

You say you and your girlfriend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies

You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

And now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

*Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends
 Before we go any further, lets be
 Friends*

 How many of us have them?

Friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving God
And they're precious beyond human evaluation
But you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke
And the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless nights
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
Somewhere where nothing much ever happens
But a few of my friends are big people
They'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court
They're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words
And yet they're no more precious in God's eyes or in mine
Than those wonderful nobody's who live and die in small towns
Who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement and concern
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
The most important thing they have in common is their ability
To share with you your most sky splitting joys
Or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends

I want to know
What you feel inside
Is something wrong
Why did you leave last night
Is it all just a game
Oh, tell me why we can't be lovers

I do believe
In the two of us
That you and me
We are the only ones
And we were meant to be true
So, tell me why we can't be lovers

How could I be such a fool
I thought I already knew it all, but I know
I was totally wrong

Listen to your heartbeat
It will take you higher
Follow your emotions
I know you'll get stronger

Listen to your heartbeat
Your feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion
I know it's inside you

How will I know
If you're fooling me
Maybe I'm wrong
But it seems, to be like
it's all just a game
And I just want us to be lovers

We had it all in our hands
Just like those all happy ends
I still don't know why
But we lost it somehow

One more chance to make a try
Nothing left to do for you and I

Listen to your heartbeat

Walking on the moon
People at the bottom of the sea
People in tombs

People in igloos
Even a tribe of pygmies

People are the main spring
Turning the world around
People, they're the main spring
Spinning this world upside down

People sun people toast
People tire shile other people smoke
People bowl people rock
People pay to see two people box

Dress me baby me
Phone me wire me
House me bug me fire me

It's a chilly Florentine evening
Two men in evening hats
Telling tales of the underground and
fishing for Reds
Policemen armed with Uzis
stand guard but they don't speak
Ain't seen no Michaeangelo
he'll be here next week.
The girl in the shoes
with the crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother
They raise a glass of amber wine
take pictures of each other
of the policemen in the fountains
and the sickle and the hammer
and they came with Uncle Romulus
with his walking cane and camera
She looked like someone's girlfriend
she looked like a dream
she looked as unlikely
as the people's limousine.

Come and sit by me, girl, before I breathe the breath out of you
Hush your mouth and cover your eyes for I'll tell your father of you
He paid to have you painted in the company of angels
Only to find you flirting anew with Chico Marx and perverted Engels

The patron saint of television smiles down from the shelf
Romulus can't criticize but he can't bless himself
He has a tin of pea-green paint and a big roll of black tape
To vandalize these obscenities then make his escape

She walked up to the nice policeman and asked him for a match
He saw Romulus approaching and slipped off the safety catch
Then cut down her uncle, he was painted red and green
Just as she was kidnapped in the people's limousine.

featuring The Fugees




The wickedest combination in the world!






[Pras]

Walk around in the record industry

I'm looking at all the Pharasees

Asking me where I'm going

All I know is one day that Babylon will be fallen

They welcome me into Jerusalem

Eighty niggas highly crucial by Ham

I got my .45 by my side

Just in case another nigga tests me someone's gonna die



[Wyclef Jean]

Bo bo so bo I leave the boat for the pope

Smoke mad weed but not touch Bayley Coke

Primary purpose of the set

Is to present techniques and guided practice

And forced access to forfeit

Emcees lose focus

Wyclef to accomplish throwing crumbs in the hell pit

Vocabulary, comprehension, steady reading and critical analyzing

Techniques to enable DJ's to interact with my material

Play it on your turntable scratch it if you're able

Characteristics, circumstances

Will determine how long you live Mr. actor, Mrs. actress



[Pras]

I act will snatch gats from kids with packed back black raps

In an Ac to get with that









[Wise Intelligent]

Black people say I represent when I get my chance

But when I'm rippin' to this beat, yo it's my nubian dance

That I be doing

Around these suckers' titles that I ruin

Although you do not like the flow you should not have been booing

Now you and your crew had better get your act together

Before I have to cut the fool release the stormy weather

Whatever you say, but nigga pop your shit my way

And you'll be screaming "Mercy me" like if your name was Marvin Gaye

Now put it away and stay the fuck up out my face

I smack you in the mouth homeboy and you'll be missing taste

What a waste to everything existing up till now

So many claiming butter but just don't be knowing how









[Pras]

For sure I'm law to be the poor righteous conscious

You might just feel thrust when I touch like Midas

My toungue is gigantic, lyrics are tremendous

Wyclef and Pras they drop hits wherever they goes like Gladys

Catch the midnight train to Georgia

As my tongue does a dropkick like Sgt. Slaughter

New world order, you lions who are trying to roar

I'll silence you lambs like Jodie Foster

There's no need to feel sentimental

Parental guidance is advised for those who despise

The Wise and Intelligent, Refugees, immigrants









[Wise Intelligent]

May...I... kick a little something for the G-O-D's in the J-E-are-S-E-why

Because you niggas know me I'm the da gan ya dee

Sixteen five four three five coincide freak wise

Time you recognize who run up in the nine

Rush like water raw cuts in your guts

Trails from Rozelle oh hell we rock bells

Live as Stuyvesant, Wise and them, rise again

The Gods A.V.G. they'll bomb Washin-

No man 'em trouble they jet something

Don't make me have to kick you on your God damned chin

I'll frappe you in your head with bottle of Heinekein

La

Mister Wise



[Lauryn Hill]

OK, ha

My intellect will protect what you threaten

Captain to Lieutenant, even take cadets in

I take them all rich and to the powerful

Don't fear no other force I be defining your hardcore

The folklore you spread down over tracks

Got you gassed off some shit may I suggest Ex-Lax

Relax! Your whole perception seems to be distorted

In my dimensions fake refugees get deported

Jokers be biting each other's styles so much it's eerie

So many deja vu's but can't no other crews come near me

It's weary, my brothers couldn't hold this if they grasped it

Confession to Jesus are even tried to master

I passed it off the levels of your mere mathematics

I'm on some astrophysics Quantum Leaping on your tactics

Triple bypasses, your crew's slow as molasses

While I amass cream like Jackie Kennedy Onassis



Ah ah ah ah

Refugee P.R.T. connect

New Jersey, this is how we do it




The righteous would never live and the righteous would never die

Poor Righteous teachers and Refugees come to testify

We world sexy style

Yo

Allies, fire in the sky
Splinters in the eye, don't know any better.
Keep your, arsenal at bay,
Live another day, pull yourself together.
Every, war you want to win,
There's nothing to defend, nothing to surrender.
I don't, want to fight alone,
No one does.

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy.
Somehow, this war is out if control,
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes.

Nice try, cross enemy lines,
Look out for the mines, buried in the mirror.
Fall out, target on the move,
Coming into view, coming in clearer.
By now, no one else around,
Narrowing it down, guess I got to figure.
One war, is all I can afford,
No more.

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy.
Somehow, this war is out if control,
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes.

Here we go
Wasting lives one way or another
Here we go
Vacant eyes rearranging their color

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy.
Somehow, this war is out if control,
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes.

Here we go
Wasting lives one way or another
Here we go
Vacant eyes rearranging their color

Wasting lives one way or another

I saw a friend of mine the other day,
He said, "I love you, but I just can't stay,"
Lord, he seemed so very far away,
In his eyes I saw a look that I could not ignore, a look I'd seen so many times before,
God, he keeps on coming back for more; one more try.

When you're hurt,
When you scream,
There's a hope, there's a dream.

Harmony, harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,
We all need sweet harmony.

A paid attendant at a filling station,
A cherished member of the united nation,
A woman crying out of desperation; can't they see?
And there's a loneliness deep inside,
The kind of feeling that you just can't hide,
Don't you know I'll be there by your side?
You can count on me.

When you're hurt,
When you scream,
There's a hope, there's a dream.

Harmony, harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,
We all need sweet harmony, oh.

When you're hurt,
When you scream,
There's a hope, there's a dream.

Harmony, harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,
In all you do, in all you see,
Harmony, sweet harmony,

featuring The Fugees




The wickedest combination in the world!






[Pras]

Walk around in the record industry

I'm looking at all the Pharasees

Asking me where I'm going

All I know is one day that Babylon will be fallen

They welcome me into Jerusalem

Eighty niggas highly crucial by Ham

I got my .45 by my side

Just in case another nigga tests me someone's gonna die



[Wyclef Jean]

Bo bo so bo I leave the boat for the pope

Smoke mad weed but not touch Bayley Coke

Primary purpose of the set

Is to present techniques and guided practice

And forced access to forfeit

Emcees lose focus

Wyclef to accomplish throwing crumbs in the hell pit

Vocabulary, comprehension, steady reading and critical analyzing

Techniques to enable DJ's to interact with my material

Play it on your turntable scratch it if you're able

Characteristics, circumstances

Will determine how long you live Mr. actor, Mrs. actress



[Pras]

I act will snatch gats from kids with packed back black raps

In an Ac to get with that









[Wise Intelligent]

Black people say I represent when I get my chance

But when I'm rippin' to this beat, yo it's my nubian dance

That I be doing

Around these suckers' titles that I ruin

Although you do not like the flow you should not have been booing

Now you and your crew had better get your act together

Before I have to cut the fool release the stormy weather

Whatever you say, but nigga pop your shit my way

And you'll be screaming "Mercy me" like if your name was Marvin Gaye

Now put it away and stay the fuck up out my face

I smack you in the mouth homeboy and you'll be missing taste

What a waste to everything existing up till now

So many claiming butter but just don't be knowing how









[Pras]

For sure I'm law to be the poor righteous conscious

You might just feel thrust when I touch like Midas

My toungue is gigantic, lyrics are tremendous

Wyclef and Pras they drop hits wherever they goes like Gladys

Catch the midnight train to Georgia

As my tongue does a dropkick like Sgt. Slaughter

New world order, you lions who are trying to roar

I'll silence you lambs like Jodie Foster

There's no need to feel sentimental

Parental guidance is advised for those who despise

The Wise and Intelligent, Refugees, immigrants









[Wise Intelligent]

May...I... kick a little something for the G-O-D's in the J-E-are-S-E-why

Because you niggas know me I'm the da gan ya dee

Sixteen five four three five coincide freak wise

Time you recognize who run up in the nine

Rush like water raw cuts in your guts

Trails from Rozelle oh hell we rock bells

Live as Stuyvesant, Wise and them, rise again

The Gods A.V.G. they'll bomb Washin-

No man 'em trouble they jet something

Don't make me have to kick you on your God damned chin

I'll frappe you in your head with bottle of Heinekein

La

Mister Wise



[Lauryn Hill]

OK, ha

My intellect will protect what you threaten

Captain to Lieutenant, even take cadets in

I take them all rich and to the powerful

Don't fear no other force I be defining your hardcore

The folklore you spread down over tracks

Got you gassed off some shit may I suggest Ex-Lax

Relax! Your whole perception seems to be distorted

In my dimensions fake refugees get deported

Jokers be biting each other's styles so much it's eerie

So many deja vu's but can't no other crews come near me

It's weary, my brothers couldn't hold this if they grasped it

Confession to Jesus are even tried to master

I passed it off the levels of your mere mathematics

I'm on some astrophysics Quantum Leaping on your tactics

Triple bypasses, your crew's slow as molasses

While I amass cream like Jackie Kennedy Onassis



Ah ah ah ah

Refugee P.R.T. connect

New Jersey, this is how we do it




The righteous would never live and the righteous would never die

Poor Righteous teachers and Refugees come to testify

We world sexy style

Yo

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly,
Blackbird fly
Into the light
Of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Can you stop your instincts
Can you man your thought control, sir?
Will you give the last command
Or lie to a good soldier

I'm a doubter
I'm a fool
Let me be
All that I am

[Chorus]
I am not so sure
What you want me for
Either your machine
Is a fool, or me

Now there is no time to wait
No time to think it over
Take the path, believe the math
You'll tell me when it's over

I'm a fighter
I've a question
Won't you answer me?

I have earned the right to know
And tell you what I see

[Chorus]

We're all on our own
Look at us all
How can we not raise
A voice
Against the madness

There isn't the time
To worry or wait
'Cause only the young
Can carry the weight
And face the silence

[Chorus]
Do we run
Do we stop

Do we lie down?
I think not
There is an answer
That we've got
We are not helpless

The vision will stand
As blindness will fall
Now we must look
For the light
In the darkness

[Chorus]

Do we lie down?
I think not
There is an answer
That we've got
We are not helpless

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around the dirty town
And the children let out from their schools

I was standing on a noisy corner
I was waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
He was playin' real good for free

Me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and about thirty-seven criminal
Escorting me to this halls

And I'll play if you have some money
Or if you're a friend to me
But that one-man band by the quick lunch stand
He was just playin' real good for free

Nobody, I say nobody, nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew they had never seen him on their TV screen
So they passed his music by

Me I meant to go over ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signals changed
He was still playin' real good for free

Without you...
Without you...
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
If I could relive my life
I know what I would change
All the times I made you cry
All my thoughts that caused you pain.
I know "I'm sorry" is not big enough
To tell you how wrong I've been
But I don't know where to start
To live my life without you...
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.
Without you...
Without you...
As the days go passing by
My feelings stay the same
I have you always on my mind
I'm living constantly in pain
I know I really should be moving on
But the memories won't go away
I have you always in my heart
And when I close my eyes I find you.
You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.

You're the one that I love
And I can't go on without you.

Without you...

Holding you could be so easy
I can feel your arms around me
Holding you holding you loving you

I can feel your arms around me
Holding you holding you loving you
Holding you could be so easy

Give me a job give me security
Give me a chance to survive
I'm just a poor soul in the unemployment line
My God I'm hardly alive

My mother 'n father, my wife and my friends
You've seen them laugh in my face
But I've got the power and I've got the will
I'm not a charity case

I'll take those long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my eye on the keyhole
If it takes all that to be just what I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Make me an offer that I can't refuse
Make me respectable man
This is my last time in the unemployment line
So like it or not

I'll take those long night, impossible odds
Keeping my back to the wall
If it takes all night to be just who I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Keeping my mind on a better life
Where happiness is only a heartbeat away
Paradise can it be all I heard it was
I close my eyes and maybe I'm already there
(repeat chorus)

You see the world through your cynical eyes
You're a troubled young man I can tell
You've got it all in the palm of your hand
But your hand's wet with sweat and your head needs a rest

And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it
Why must you be such an angry young man
When your future looks quite bright to me
How can there be such a sinister plan
That could hide such a lamb, such a caring young man

You're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat and you know it
Come on, let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it

You're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat and you know it
Come on, let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it

Oh Mama I'm in fear for my life
From the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running
And I'm so far from my home
Oh mama I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

This jig is up the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
This will be the end today of the wanted man

Oh mama I've been years on the lam
And had a high price on my head
Lawman said get him dead or alive
Now it's for sure he'll see me dead

Oh mama I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

This jig is up the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
The judge will have revenge today
On the wanted man

Welcome to the Grand illusion
Come on in and see what's happening
Pay the price, get your tickets for the show
The stage is set, the band starts playing
Suddenly your heart is pounding
Wishing secretly you were a star.

But don't be fooled by the radio
The TV or the magazines
They show you photographs of how your life should be
But they're just someone else's fantasy
So if you think your life is complete confusion
Because you never win the game
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same.
We're all the same

So if you think your life is complete confusion
Because your neighbors got it made
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same.
We're all the same

America spells competition, join us in our blind ambition
Get yourself a brand new motor car
Someday soon we'll stop to ponder what on Earth's this spell we're under
We made the grade and still we wonder who the hell we are

I've got a hot chilly feeling I don't understand.
I've got to run through this minute like a hurricane.
I've got to tighten my wire from the sense to the soul.
I find my back to the wall when it's time to go.
I've got to know is that your heartbeat?

Paint...me right.
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.

I get a love shock/electric from the touch of your hand.
I'm getting lost in the riddles of the modern man.
I've got it up down all around tied to the bone.
Hey there's a strange situation on the late night show.
I've got to know is that your heartbeat?

Paint...me right.
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.
Do it right, I can feel the woman in me tonight.
Oh I, I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.

Paint!

Paint!

Collide a clause, unremitting can you cram?

I know you're dumb as paint.

Take your brush and gently dip it
Be careful not to drip it
Wet paint
( background singing cows "wet paint,wet paint")

Wet your roller then you roll it
Calmly cooly you control it
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint)

Red and green and yellow too
Purple pink and baby blue
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

You pour it in a bucket
You mush it all around
You take a mop and mop it
Oh you slather it and slop it
But be careful not to drop it
On the cold cold ground

Wet paint, wet paint
Wet paint, wet paint

Drippy, lumpy, gushy, gloppy
Smeary, smelly, slippy, sloppy
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

Squishy, squashy, muddy, mushy
Sticky, slimy, slurpy, slushy
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

Smear it, roll it, throw it, brush it
Squish it, splash it, crunch and crush it
Wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

You pour it in a bucket
You mush it all around
You take a mop and mop it
Oh you slather it and slop it
But be careful not to drop it
On the cold cold ground

Wet paint, wet paint
You know I'm crazy 'bout wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )
Can't get enough of wet paint
( wet paint, wet paint )

Won't you let me walk you home from school
Won't you let me meet you by the pool
Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the band
And I'll take you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
Won't you tell your dad to get off my back
Tell him what we said 'bout paint it black
Rock'n roll is here to stay
Come inside now - its ok
And I'll shake you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If its no then I can go
If its yes then let me know
I won't make you
Ooh ooh oh oooh

You come in while I'm sitting at the mirror
You want to say you know that I look nice
I sit in desperate silence and I listen
And with a cutting eye,you know you'd better look twice

''cause I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
And before you say it looks great
You'd better look again

Red is for the anger that you put me through
And for all those nights I felt alone,will see a shade of blue
I'll add a dash of yellow for the power that you've been
And the black will be your night ahead
And my shadow in your bed
I'm putting on my war paint

There's nothing you can say to make it better
And there's no apology to change my mind
I guess I could have sent a "Dear John" letter
But it's written on my face,it's war paint time

''cause I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
And before you say it looks great
You'd better look again

I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
I'm putting on my war paint
I'm on the path again
I'm putting on my (War Paint)
Red is for the anger that you put me through

I heard the notes all fade away
Leaving memorial stones
Yesterday's thoughts have come to stay
Until they decompose
A picture paints a thousand words
With nothing much to say
What last night seemed had to be heard
Is left unsaid today
So when you said you understood
I couldn't understand
I was looking at an empty beach
As you saw all the grains of sand
I was counting views from windows
When you looked in from outside
The light was blurred and distant
And several cities wide
So I turn up the volume
To hear the notes so dim
You said you couldn't hear it
So I asked you to come in
Then you held up a mirror
And I saw my face congeal
I was thin and getting thinner
And I dreamt for real

Paint a rumour
(What's it gonna spread?)
Paint a rumour
(See the place go red)

I could tell you something
(Promise not to tell)
I could tell you something
(Promise not to sell)

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

I have heard a whisper
I have heard a whisper
(What did it say?)
I heard a whisper
(Make it go away)

Don't believe a word of it
(Promise not to tell)
Don't repeat a word of it
(Promise not to sell)

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's my secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

Paint a rumour
Paint a rumour
(See the place go red)

I could tell you something
I could tell you something

Suddenly before my eyes
Hues of indigo arise
With them how my spirit sighs
Paint the sky with stars

Only night will ever know
Why the heavens never show
All the dreams there are to know
Paint the sky with stars

Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly?
As the heavens seem so far now,
Who will paint the midnight star?

Night has brought to those who sleep
Only dreams they cannot keep
I have legends in the deep
Paint the sky with stars

Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly?
As the heavens seem so far now,
Who will paint the midnight star?

Place a name upon the night
One to set your heart alight
And to make the darkness bright
Paint the sky with stars.





Girl before the mirror
Appraises her disguise
Child become a mother
Tries to fix her eyes
No more of his excuses
It has to be today
She can keep her fantasy
If she can get away

Paint her name on a one-way street
Painted cheeks with angry heat
Wounded pride on painted eyes
Paint the night with battle cries

All puffed up with vanity
We see what we want to see
To the beautiful and the wise
The mirror always lies

Boy before the mirror
Checks his camouflage
Polishes his armor
And the charger in the garage
No more lame excuses
It has to be tonight
He can take the princess
If he can take the fight

Pound the drums with martial beat
Pound the streets with marching feet
Wounded pride, distorted eyes
Paint the night with battle cries

All puffed up with vanity
We see what we want to see
To the powerful and the wise
The mirror always lies

Boys and girls together
Mistake conceit for pride
Ambition for illusion
Dreams for self-delusion
Girls and boys together
See what it is we lack
Boys and girls together
Let's paint the mirror black
Paint it black

Run my finger
Down the window
Paint a picture
It is so cold

Lonely in Idaho
Turn on late night blue light,
Hotels, early flights,
I don't know

Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
For the good

Oh on the eastern shore
The ocean was all I came for
I'll tune your old guitar
Dig a pony, water, mason jar,
It's "anything you want"

I can hear you whistling
while you're getting your dresses made
Getting lost under the summers by the lake
If we decide to go

Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
Everything
Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is, everything is

In the distant sea, you could be my queen
Float away on a bumble bee
In my dream, the castle on King somehow flies away

Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is going to change
Everything
Everything
Everything is going to change
Everything is, everything is





I see a red door
and I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day

I look inside myself and
See my heart is black
I see my red door
And must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun,
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

I see a red door
and I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

(Humming)

I want to see it painted
painted black, black as night
black as coal
I want to see the sun
blotted out from the sky
I want to see it painted painted
painted, Painted Black
YEAH!

(Humming)

Face to face, but miles away
Building trenches out of empty spaces
Lay here, next to me
And close the distance in between

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're tryna hide
Take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake
Of our war paint

Scar to scar, I wanna know
Every story that you never told
Don't shut me out, don't think too much
Don't keep that barricade up

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're tryna hide
Take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake
Of our war paint

So hold me close and kiss my skin
Don't be afraid, let me in
I'll hold you close and take your hand
To my heart, here I am, yeah (Oh)
Oh

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break
Our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake ('Cause we could be beautiful)
Of our war paint

'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint
Our war paint (Without our war paint)
And we could have it all once we let our walls break (We could have it all)
Our walls break (We could have it all)
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line? (The front line)
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake
Of our war paint, our war paint

Tell me the tales that to me were so dear
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Sing me the songs I delighted to hear
Long, long ago, long ago

Now you are come all my grief is removed
Let me forget for how long you have roved
Let me believe that you love as you loved
Long, long ago, long ago

Do you remember the path where we met
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Ah yes, you told me you ne'er forget
Long, long ago, long ago

Then, to all others, my smile you preferred
Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word
Still my heart treasures the praises I heard
Long, long ago, long ago

There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the breath of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long

I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand
And for the cause of Christ
I have spent my days believing

What He'd have me be is who I am
As I've come see the weaker side of me
I've realized his grace is what I need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

For God so loved the world that He sent His Son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge to set us free
Oh, but deep within our hearts
There is still a war that rages

And makes the sacrifice so hard to see
As midnight fell on crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away
And as evil tried to stop redemption's flow

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

And now when Heaven looks at me
It's through the blood of Jesus
Reminding me of one day long ago

Mercy said no, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no, sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank you Jesus
Mercy said no

They were young and they were free
There were twelve men who believed
In a man who asked them to leave
It all behind and follow me

So they set out on this journey
Not knowing where He would lead
But soon they would see clearly
What the price would have to be

That day would come
When they would choose to live or give their lives away
They could have run
But with their final breath Heaven heard them say

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

We don't see Him with our eyes
Can't touch the scars that are on His side
Still we feel Him in our souls
And now we know that He's alive

And our message is the same
As the twelve who made the way
With a faith that God will live inside
Of those who call His name

The day has come
To lose ourselves and give our lives away
All for the One
Who's in our hearts, we raise our hands

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

I believe, I believe in the promise
Of a life that no man can steal away
I believe, I believe we'll all see Jesus
And we'll worship Him forever

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark
We'll follow you anywhere
We love you Jesus

We love you Jesus
With all our hearts
Our Lord and Savior
You've been so good to us

We love you Jesus
You are the light in the dark

Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves

Driving down the highway
It jumped out and caught my eye
Painted there in neon green
Well, it couldn't be denied

Just two simple words
On that bridge for all to see
The answer for a lonely world
How easy could it be?

Complicated living needs a complicated cure
At least that's what I've heard
But suddenly what I believe gripped the very heart of me
As simple as it seems, nothing says it better than

Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
There's nothing more that I can say
It's just enough that Jesus saves

There's a man in Southern Haiti
Who's got a call to reach the lost
He's schooled in his theology
And all the meanings of the cross

He sees a world that's dying
Knows the one thing left to say
Is wrapped up in two simple words
That are never gonna change

I think it's time we put aside
Things that only cloud the mind
It's enough to speak the truth
Take a look, you will see, what it is that sets us free
As simple as it seems, nothing says it better than

Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus saves, I know that Jesus saves
There's nothing more that I can say
It's just enough that Jesus saves

He came for the lost and the hurting
Oh and He died for the broken souls
And He lived for the ones who are searching
We've gotta let 'em know

Jesus, I know that Jesus
Jesus, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus, I know that Jesus
Yeah, yeah, Jesus, I know that Jesus saves

Jesus, I know that Jesus
Yeah, yeah, Jesus, I know that Jesus saves
Jesus, I know that Jesus
Yeah, yeah, Jesus, I know that Jesus saves

He saved me, He forgave me
Yes, Jesus saves that's just enough
He saved me, He forgave me
Yes, Jesus saves it's just enough

Yes, Jesus saves, yes, Jesus saves
Yes, Jesus saves, it's just enough
I know He saves, I know He saves
I know He saves, I know He saves me

I know, I know, I know He saves
I know He picked me up
He turned me around
He placed my feet on the [Incomprehensible]

[Chorus]
Well may the world go,
The world go, the world go,
Well may the world go,
When I'm far away.

Well may the skiers turn,
The swimmers churn, the lovers burn
Peace, may the generals learn
When I'm far away.

[Chorus]

Sweet may the fiddle sound
The banjo play the old hoe down
Dancers swing round and round
When I'm far away.

[Chorus]

Fresh may the breezes blow
Clear may the streams flow
Blue above, green below
When I'm far away.

[Chorus]

The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me

Take one fresh and tender kiss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Add one stolen night of bliss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
One girl, one boy; some grief, some joy
(I was rover, but now it's over
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Memories are made of this

Your lips and mine, two sips of wine

Memories are made of this
(I was rover, but now it's over
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor, stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays These are the dreams you will savor
With His blessings from above
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Serve it generously with love
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
One man, one wife, on love through life

Little airports keep in mind
They got file folders and dry-erase boards
I retired from the air force
Long enough ago to know

The sky is open

I call the tower and draw the line
I'm flying, yes I'm climbing
A better pilot couldn't find
Even so, even I can only fly so high

The sky is open

In the war I flew the islands
I knew the quiet, it's pilot science
My propeller tries to find the air
I'm finally the highest bird

The sky is open

Student why do you dream of me
When you dream of your acre of trees
It was agreed
I came to burn leaves
It's all I ever claimed to do
A plow man I'll never grow into

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh

Blue in the broad light of day
Your claws are snagged on my face
Say it, I wish we were naked and
I wish that I could take it
When you turn on me

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh I don't want my words twisted
I don't want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope that I can keep seeing you
As long you as you don't say you're falling in love

Crave translates into slave
No one can harness the rain
And I can make myself into rain
You'll feel me on your cheek
And on your sleeve

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh I don't want my words twisted
I don't want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope I can keep seeing you
As long as you don't say you're falling in love
But I can feel you about to forget
Yes I can feel you about to forget

It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street





Out where the creek turn shallow and sandy
And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars
When the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops
Straight into my arms
Straight into my arms

I'm ridin' hard carryin' a cache of roses
A fresh map that I made
Now I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul
And dance on it's grave
And dance on it's grave

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here

Well my daddy he was just a stranger
Lived in a hotel downtown
Well when I was a kid he was just somebody
Somebody I'd see around
Somebody I'd see around

Well now down below and pullin' on my shirt
Yeah I got some kids of my own
Well if I had one wish for you in this god forsaken world, kid
It'd be that your mistakes will be your own
That your sins will be your own

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here

(Whoaaa)

Out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia*
Where the sword of Orion sweeps
It's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires
And you breathin' in your sleep
And you breathin' in your sleep

Well there's just a spark of a campfire left burnin'
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside
Reach 'neath your shirt, put my hands across your belly and feel
Another one kickin' inside
And I ain't gonna fuck it up this time

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here

(Whoaaa)

I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;

When you're smiling, When you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

When you're smiling, When you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.

"Clang, clang, clang" went the trolley
"Ding, ding, ding" went the bell
"Zing, zing, zing" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell

"Chug, chug, chug" went the motor
"Bump, bump, bump" went the brake
"Thump, thump, thump" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

"Buzz, buzz, buzz" went the buzzer
"Plop, plop, plop" went the wheels
"Stop, stop, stop" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line

I came back on the trail of a man
Things are the same as when I left
Well I so wanted to say hey
But I know you think my sentence was too light
Now time should have put this behind us
Some things I won't soon forget
Bride and bridle are too close in a man's mind
And I know you think my sentence was too light

You, you weren't true
But I can't blame a woman who changes
Three thousand, six hundred and fifty-odd days I waited
Time, I did my time

Now I long since quit feeling my hands
Still, three men have a date with me
I could have found them all before now
And I know they think my sentence was too light
Your father bet ten years against this day
He wed his girl to a better man
But he stands here now with his hat in his hands
And I know he thinks my sentence was too light

I know I wasn't made to play on a team
You weighed your suitcase down but it still wouldn't sink
I know that crime doesn't pay
But I don't know any other way

the way that she smiles me down
She claims to be clowning
I finally long for someone
Teaspoon

two can just bleed into one
But only one does the bleeding
She calls me the alphabet gun
Teaspoon

I know I wasn't made to play on a team
You weighed your suitcase down but it still wouldn't sink
I know that crime doesn't pay
But I don't know any other way

She orders the pilot to land
She just wants to hold the man
Well I am her pilot today
Teaspoon

Washington's on the one
I'm in the middle of speaking
And you're under the gun
Seething, leave it to the lone nut
It's unappealing in someone so young
Plaintive, you're feeling so washed up
And you mean it when you say you're done
Five lanes of freeway
But it's all gone dark
You called to say you're gonna run
Well,Can you wait?
Can you stand it?
Are you brave or are you scared straight?
Speak right, be strong, act nice, take so long
Call time, seem tired, leave mad, get so wired
Maybe you belong to someone
Maybe you have finally met them
Maybe smoke belongs in the sky
Maybe I hate it when you cry
You were hurt so you got hard
You were cursed and scolded and scared
You were searched for, then ignored
You want to burn the liars?
You'll set us both on fire
You're faking, so I'm pretend sleeping
Waiting for this to be fun
It's true little miss mean mini-bar guard
We're gonna have to try something new
Let me breath fire down on you

I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you
I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you

In old Transylvania when I was a lad
Our castle was poor but we never were sad
We learned to be happy
We'd dance round the hall
And learning to count was the key to it all
By counting each count I knew just where to start
And one special step has stayed close to my heart

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

So now in my own castle I can enjoy
This wonderful dance that I learned as a boy
I see just how wise was my whole family
They taught me to count and so now look at me
I'm counting and dancing and I swear that it's true
If you do the same you will be happy too

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

One bat hanging in the steeple
One bat flies in through the door
That makes two bats in my belfry
WONDERFUL!
(spoken) But wait, there's more ...

Once up on a time a man was attacked by a vampire bird
He was sucked to death
The vampire bird killed him at last

Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat

The lake of fire tore his ass up
He was burning to the crisp
He was cast into the lake of burning flame

Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat

After the vampire bird sucked blood out of me, he started stabbing me in my ass
Then three more vampire birds stabbed me in my ass too
They sucked the blood out of me, killing me

Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat

Folgers, it's good to the last drop

I'm not afraid to show you who I am
And I am not ashamed of my life
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road
I've always felt you deep in my bones

With every step I rise and fall
With everything to gain I end up losing it all
When the darkness gets in
I scream out and your light sets me free

I'm not afraid of the past no more
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good
I used to dance to the devil's beat
If I could bust into hell I would

I'm not afraid to shed all my skin
I'm not afraid of the faults you see
I'm tearing down these walls right now
They're comin' down 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

I'm not afraid when they kick me down
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed
I'm not afraid if I live or die
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

And I wish that I could give you something in return
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned

And in the end you'll finally see
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need

I'm not afraid of the the truth no more
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did

I'm not afraid of the things you know
I'm just a book for the world to read
My final words on the final page
Will be amends 'cause I believe

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black
The way me forgive me and just take me back
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your love is blind, blind as a bat
The way that you're leading me home like that
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black

Saw your nightmare bat go by my window
Saw them two lingering
Couldn't be a rabbit
Flying like usual
Couldn't be the habit
You saw them, too
Oh, every evening

So oh, goes
Oh, into the nightmare
Sun rising black instead of gold
Now or never
Saw your nightmare bat go by my window

Here I lie
In a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time
In a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home
I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you
You're goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you
You're goin' nowhere

Night and day
There's a burning down inside of me
Burning love
With a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go
And I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear

Simpletons cross my path, I don't know this anymore
Looking after me, I don't hear them anymore
The writer send the words, I don't read them anymore
I will wait for you, until the day
Yes I will wait for you, if I may
The day's a longer time for you
And it will all be fine for you

Giants and dragons fight, I don't feel them anymore
Apples and oranges, I can't taste them like before
The simple things again, I don't feel them anymore
I will wait for you, until the day
Yes I will wait for you, if I may
The day's a longer time for you
And it will all be fine for you

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

I will call upon Your name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine

If there is a love song left to sing
Then what I have is what I'll bring
Nothing more is more than I can give

If there is a light left in my eyes
It must be your reflection from the sky
'Cause all I know is this
You are the wonder of my world

You are an ocean that I can get lost in
The first wind on my shore
You are the sunrise to open my eyes
And the dark night is no more
You are an ocean, You are an ocean

And every time I turn around
There's so much more left to be found
And every glimpse steals my breath away

So open up these eyes to see
More of you and less of me
And all my fear is turning into faith
You are the wonder of my world

You are an ocean that I can get lost in
The first wind on my shore
You are the sunrise to open my eyes
And the dark night is no more
You are an ocean, You are an ocean

I'm drowning in your love
I'm drowning in your love
Not coming up
I'm not coming up
'Cause you're all I'll ever want

You are an ocean, You are an ocean

You are an ocean that I can get lost in
The first wind on my shore
You are the sunrise to open my eyes
And the dark night is no more
You are an ocean, You are an ocean
You are an ocean, You are an ocean

You are an ocean

So you think you're in the middle of the ocean
Stranded on an island of your own
Or stuck in the top of a mountain
Either way you're gonna say you're all alone
And I hesitate to say that you're a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I'm leaving you to you or someone else
'Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I'd meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me go
It used to be I'd tell you all my secrets
Giving you the credit you deserve
I guess you didn't care to lose or keep it
And we never quite connected from the first
And I wish I had a way to make it better
To rearrange the world and make you smile
But it's dumb to even think I had that power
And we haven't been that close in a while
And I don't even want to try to name it
Explain it for the one who couldn't care
'Cause all that matters is the way you choose to frame it
And I hesitate to say that you're a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I'm leaving you to you or someone else
'Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I'd meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me go

Here comes the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves where've they been ?

Don't swim tonight my love
The sea is mad my love
It's known to drive men crazy
Now come that murder seeks
The castle is dead and reeks
The madness can make you lazy

Here come the waves
down by the shore
Washing the rocks that have been here
centuries or more

Down by the sea

Here come the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves where've they been ?

Castles glowing at night
Towers above out fright
What did happen here
Now comes it in my head
I serve you bread on a pledge
Think of your mouth for dinner

But here come the waves
down by the sea
Washing the eyes of the men
who have died

Down by the sea

Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves





She scratches a letter
Into a wall made of stone
Maybe, someday another child
Won't feel as alone as she does

It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid fuck and Mommy agrees

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play, pretend
She could join the game, boy
She could be another clone

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

What you taught me, put me here
Don't come visit, Mother
Sing it

Oh, why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

What you taught me, put me here
Now don't visit Mother, Mother

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I see elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady
Docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road

Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch

Uh huh, uh huh

You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

When I went to your town on the wide open shore
Oh I must confess, I was drawn, I was drawn to the ocean
I thought it spoke to me, it said, "Look at us,
We're not churches, not schools, not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?"
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body
And that's when I came back to town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly, oh the ocean said
"What are you trying to find, I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors, I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean,"
But the ocean can't come to this town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

And the ones that can know you so well are the ones that can swallow you whole.
I have a good and I have an evil, I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I didn't go back today
I wanted to show you that I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them
You said, "Let me tell you the song of this town"
You said, "Everything closes at five. After that, well, you just got the bars
You don't know how precious you are, walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean.

It's where we came from, you know, and sometimes I just want to go back
After a day, we drink til we're drowning, walk to the ocean, wade in with our work boots
Wade in our work boots, try to finish the job.
You don't know how precious you are, I am the one who lives with the ocean
You don't know how I am the one. You don't know how I am the one."

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Ain't no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door
Got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball.
Got a hell hound on my t(r)ail'
'Cause it's hell I'm headed for'
(No one really knows which one it is)
Uh-huh! oh oh yeah!
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing 'bout good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, then the ocean lost it's way.
I've been there (I don't know?)
Oh oh yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Na na na..., la la la...
Sitting round singing songs til the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start.
Oh yeah!
It sure is fine!
Blow my mind!
(He's saying _something_ here)
Yeah yeah!
Do wop a diddly diddly...
Oh, so good!

When I went to your town
On the wide open shore
Oh, I must confess, I was drawn
I was drawn to the ocean

I thought it spoke to me, It said, "Look at us

Not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?"
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body

And that's when I came back to town
This town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are
You don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming, back from the ocean

I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers
I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly

Oh, the ocean said, "What are you trying to find
I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors
I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh, it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean"

But the ocean can't come to this town
This town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are
You don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean

And the ones that can know you so well
Are the ones, that can swallow you whole
I have a good and I have an evil
I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean

I didn't go back today, I wanted to show you
That I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers, I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them

You said, "Let me tell you the song of this town"
You said, "Everything closes at five
After that, well you just got the bars"

You don't know how precious you are
Walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean
It's where we came from, you know
And sometimes I just want to go back
After a day, we drink 'til we're drowning

Walk to the ocean, wade in with our workboots
Wade in our workboots, try to finish the job
You don't know how precious you are
I am the one who lives with the ocean
You don't know how, I am the one
You don't know how, I am the one

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

And from the tips of your fingers
Down to the soles of your feet
A glimmer in your skin
That I can't believe
And take a trip to the sea
Let your hair run, run free
You're a rebel in disguise
Is that the devil in your eyes

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

Wider smiles than I've ever seen
Your little arms hug your body
This is more than I can take
You're the fruit that I can taste
You only seek what you give away
You'll only speak what you wanna say
You ululate like a warrior
I'll make you shake like your bed girl

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

This is our garden girl
We live in a fractured world
Willing to be the same
Same as it always was
We're in a rapture girl
We live in a lonely world
Willing to be the same
Same as it always was

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

We fell in love
Right by the ocean
Made all our plans
Down on the sand

I'll have to think about it, it's what she said to me
I'll have to think about it, all the time in the world to be
When I sleep I dream about it
I chew it when I eat
After something I can't explain
The court's adjourned in the big debate
The way you are, that's the worst thing you could do
Don't you know that's the worst thing?
Fantasyland
Come dig my art, I'm just rehearsing
I'll have to think about it, it's what she said to me
When you leave behind all the guts it takes
Who will you be?
The way you are, that's the worst thing you could do
Don't you know that's the worst thing?






I have tasted poison, still I remain restored
By centuries of saving seas where living waters pour

I am the ocean
Purified by all the tears of time
I am bitter and sublime
I am the ocean

Disregard the wreckage under healing tide
All the shame in Jesus' name
Was covered when He died

We are the ocean
Glorious and sanctified by pain
We are blessed by the rain
We are the ocean

Acid clouds will threaten but you won't be defiled
Cleansing love from God above will shower you dear
Child

You are the ocean,
Beautiful and driven by the wind
You are wondrous deep within
You are the ocean
I am the ocean
Purified by all the tears of time
I am bitter and sublime
I am the ocean
We are the ocean
You are the ocean

Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

I've got to keep on keepin' on
I just want to be beside you
Gotta do the best I can
Even though you made it plain
You don't believe in love
I cant let you go

Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man
The rhythm of your heart is like a sonnet
Pure and sweet
How you haunt my memory

Believe me baby
In this brilliant world you're the best
You're like a porcelain charm
A perfumed smile
A teenage blush
You're like champagne roses

Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man

I've got to keep on keeping on
How can I live without you
I've got to make you understand
Each species has a mate
And fate says you'll be mine
I won't let you down

Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man
The rhythm of your heart is like a sonnet
Pure and sweet
How you haunt my memory

I believe in angels
You leave me no alternative
You're like a butterfly
A gospel choir
A sun kissed sky
You're like sensual velvet

Believe me baby
In this brilliant world you're the best
You're like a porcelain charm
A perfumed smile
A teenage blush
You're like sunshine roses
Come on baby can't you see
All the need in me
Like the ocean speaks to the naked man

Don't want to be the one to walk away
But I can't bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost

Can't find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Oh, we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven, help me find a way to dream within this nightmare

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

Could you ever look at me
The way you're looking at the ocean
All wounded in your smile, but holy and unriled
Could you ever look at me

Could you ever look at me
The way you're looking at the sunrise
How it settles on your face, whole and unafraid
Like the light of your world

And I don't know how
To chase away the fear I have inside me
And I don't know where it is you go
When you drift away, when you drift away

Could you ever look at me
The way you're looking at the ocean
Could you give to me that smile, if only for a while
Could you ever look at me

I don't know how
To find a way to keep you here beside me
And I don't know where it is you go
But it's beautiful to me, so beautiful to see

I hope you never look at me
The way you're looking at the ocean
'Cause in the sunrise I have seen I was never meant to be
The light of your world

When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
To make you feel my love

Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling down
Got an inch but took a mile, oh no

Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cutting deep oh no

Watch me fall now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I love you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much your're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love

Baby, I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain

Oh now you get the picture
Oh oh now you wanna fix her
Oh now your screaming let's go back
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me

Watch me fall now, I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I love you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much your're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain how come I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love

I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love
I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love
I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love

i turned the volume up this morning
till there was ringing in my ears
i haven't felt this good in years

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout

and as i'm searching for the story
subscription card falls on the floor
i'm losing interest more and more

to pick it up i'm bending over
out of the corner of my eye
i see a pair of blazing thighs

see how they twist and shout
see how they twist and shout

i straighten up to look her over
and up my back a shooting pain
it's bound to settle in my brain

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout
see how they twist and shout





All day
All night
I've been thinkin why feelin' wrong feels so right
And I know
Yeah I try
To turn myself around but I know what I like

I ain't nice
No I'm quite a dick
I'm the bad guy who's makin' you sick
It's easy for me
I've got no shame
I'm in it for the money and fame

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

There's days when I wanna give in
But it's hard to be a saint when you're full of sin
Why would I ever think of goin' back
When it feels so fuckin' good to be bad

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

I know that secretly
Everybody's rootin' for me

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Because the villain is here to stay

Everybody wants to be like me
The villain is the one that you came to see
Sick of all the good guys savin' the day
Cause the villain always wins when the hero's away

And I'm here to stay

I'm the villain

And the villain always wins when the hero's away

Never mind who set you up
Never mind who started it
Never mind what kept you going now

Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys

I been in this town so long that back in the city I been
Taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the
Spanish and Indian home of the Heroes and Villains.

Once at night, cotillion squared, the fight, and she was right
In the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what
A dude'll do in a town full of Heroes and Villains.

Heroes and Villains
Just see what you done-done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you done-done

Stand or fall, I know there shall be peace in the valley, and
It's all an affair of my life with the Heroes and Villains.

In the cantina, Margarita keeps the spirits high.
There I watched her, she spun around and wound in
The warmth, her body fanned the flame of the dance.

Dance Margarita! Don't you know I love you!

My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise.
They started slow long ago, head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise.

I been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff to ride in the rough, and Sonny,
Down snuff, I'm alright by the Heroes and Villains.

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually
Brought her down

I'm not gone be your villain anymore
Don't think I'll live a life of keeping score
I know there's something more to life
I'm sure, no, I won't be your villain anymore, anymore

I played my part, I tried to do your way
But now it's time for me to just do me
You see, I don't want to haunt you or be selfish
But I can't be your villain, baby

I'm am not your prisoner
No, you just have to let me go now
And let me be
Who I see in me, yeh

I'm so cold and far away from home
I'm so tired and so damn alone
It's darker and much harder to be me
So far away from my reality
I hate the way you look, I'm looking back
I hate the way I look, you're looking too
I think maybe I'm just falling

Cause you kiss me like you know inside of me
And you watch me fight my own insanity
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I'm stronger now than I've ever bean before

You think I never could have seen it all
It seems you want me just to watch me fall
Your fingers and your lips are beautiful
Your fingers and your lips are killing me
I hate the way you look, I'm looking back
I hate the way I look, you're looking too
I think maybe I'm just falling

Cause you kiss me like you know inside of me
And you watch me fight my own insanity
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I'm stronger now than I've ever was before

I'm stronger than I've ever been
I'm stronger than before
But you kiss me like you know it all, you know it all, you know it all

Cause you kiss me like you know inside of me
And you watch me fight my own insanity
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I feel like I'm a villain, Jesus
Said would never ever leave us
And I'm stronger now than I've ever was before
And I'm stronger now than I've ever was before

I could be the villain in your
Little book of break-ups
So spinnerule but even now
I could be your page in your
Little book of break-ups

I'm never letting go.

I'd tear into myself again.
(Myself, myself)
My skin rips like paper.
I'll never touch myself again.
(Myself, myself)

Your heart breaks like glass.

I should have been the hero in your
Little book of make-ups
But that anyone should say to you
I should have been the figure in your
Little book of make-ups

Your heart breaks like glass
Still I find a way
To fight the brilliance of your inside in this lifetime
I won't regret
I won't regret it.

What can I say? It's my turn to play the villain now.
I bet you can relate, to what I've grown to hate.
You won't feel this. You won't feel a thing.

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.

It's not my turn to fall. It's your turn after all...
This revenge is catching up to you, better slow it down.
Refusing to sink in. Giving up was your way then (this battle has yet to begin).

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.
Rest assured now.

This is where decision meets consequence.
I'll find a comeback at the bottom of this glass again.
You won't feel a thing.

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.

Rest assured now

When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken,
Sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's
Vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth a
Valium and slept
Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his
Head on the floor
Think somebody now and how he never really
Wept he says

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our
Heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to
Slip, we'd say

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmen

When my love complained, every word
A breath on my last dandelion
And so lovers will leave and their tears
Souvenirs for the very first time
I searched the world reluctant
To find a lover enthusiastic
Speak to me barely if at all

When I was a boy, funny things
Water wings kept you confident
A belly of wine, similar
To keep yourself indifferent

And I scraped the bargain basement
Bought a lover less than fantastic
Spoke to me barely if at all

Taste perfume that burns my throat
And I am free of envelope
Squeeze an instant out of me

And she placed a hand between our lips
How could anything be so precious
She kissed me barley if at all

And she, with her hand between our lips
Gave me what we now have in common
She left me barely if at all

And if I ever drive you mild, and
Suffering this open kiss
And I'm barely juvenile

When everyone is outrageous,
And I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon

And if I ever drive your style, and
Suffering your day predicted
With no ability to rile

And every yawn is is contagious
And I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon

I should drive you wild,
Yes I should drive you wild

Ever drive you mild
Ever drive you mild
Ever drive you mild





We are for today
We are for the moment

We are a crusade
But we are invalid

1 A.M. rummaging
Stained my hands on her antique
2 A.M.

Reverend girl

And I am so indifferent
And I am whatever

3 A.M. cellophane
suffocates my favorite things
4 A.M.

The reverend girl
Seems that the more we're achieving
The less chance of leaving this world
With a reverend girl

Another lover wakes me
Head upon the window pane
Before the thunder shook us
She could always smell the rain

A year is dissipating
Another hail cannot disdain
Nevermind the thunder
Now my lover smells like
Now my lover smells like
Now my lover smells like rain

I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say "187", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stares, give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind, hah

Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes, fuck all you hoes
1 million, 2 million, 3, 4

Uh, breaking up the kush, sticky fingers-onics
I'm throwing up gang signs you can see I'm in my vomit
And I'm cool right na' but please dont change the climate
'Cause I'm sleeping with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me
Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry
You niggas old news prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finga, bad bitches for my home boys
The grass is greener on the other side, I'm focused on my own yard
Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann
Take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder

Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches, fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes, fuck all you hoes
1 million, 2 million, 3, 4

We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing
And my bitch got cotton mouth, you know them snakes cannot be trusted
And I bet y'all niggas don't say shit, because I'm feeling lucky
And I still pray everynight that Aliens abduct me, Tunechi
Whattup Khaled?

Wait
The fact you did it
But don't admit it
Won't make you innocent

Fate
Will find you wicked
And turns you victim
For everything you have done
So justify the reason to kill

Reason to kill
I bet you will
You're fooling no one but yourself
But yourself
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just get it
How you manage
To justify who dies
Like judge and jury
You're the very
One who crucifies
Don't get your hands dirty to kill
Dirty to kill
Use someone else
Know all your lies are measured in hell

Measured in hell
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

[Chorus]

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

[Liffy Stokes]
The stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul
I'm 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole
I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying
I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying

Not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball
While waiting for this pussy ass job to call
And it ain't hopping
Got me tipping to hear them things popping

Cash bags dropping
With plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking
Its what I'm on
I cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone

24 years and grown with a future unknown
My heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game
But I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane
So its back to pistols and cane

Plotting on licks hitting stains
The mob life runs through my veins
Its too late for me to change
These streets got me deranged

Strapped up and paranoid
Ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid
Plus big voices getting hot
They constantly sneaking on blocks

They trying to bring me in unconscious
But them pins got popped
Now they got me on the run
Cherishing every last breath

But I ain't going back
Its freedom or death
That be my motive for murder

[Chorus]
[Liffy Stokes]
Now I know you the judge of life and death
I ain't evil or nothing
But somebody done brought me pain and sorrow
So I'ma have to kill something
Let me count the ways that I can repent
Trying to stay holy and focused
But that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus
That be my motive for murder

[Twista]
I'm a survive these streets another day
I know the pain in my heart won't go away
These mother fuckers try to murder me
And won't nobdy hurt my family
That's what he gotta die

[Mays]
9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick
If it ain't coming up with the dopest shit
Then I'm trying to cop the thickest brick
'Cause life in the belly of the best

Is equal to povertys bottomless pit
Where bitch niggas trick
And thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get
But it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick

Before its too late to get straight
And the most I make is final pick
Anywhere they shit like riding slick
With a thick chick slobbing your dick

Even if it means fighting these niggas in cases
As long as neither ones thick
'Cause I swear when I get hit
I go in a crucial rage like a flick

Turn straight lunatic
Making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick
But that don't mean my minds sick
Just cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese

When trees by the p's
And fuckin' fine fee's and 3's with ease
For sure the skilled poets
Within in the mask up kill for it

I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill
I'll bet his dumb ass will still blow it
Bullshit ain't nothing
I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank

And drive a bullet-proof hummer tank
So the next haters who try to air me out come up blank
And I'm a have to sacrifice your life
With a wrath that's stronger than christ

And forces of life that's know to do damage to human eyesight
I guess its true
Moneys the route of all evil
'Cause crooked or legal

It's all manipulated by the eagle
And be my motive for murder

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start
How I'm a hide love from this mark
This nigga made my homie die in my arms
Had to put a slug in his heart

Mother fuck that stuff
It was just a grudge on his part
My boy was young and ambitious
Took his dreams and wishes

Try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches
Drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack
And a quarter ounce of dro want a rap
I'm bout to snap

Here come the big pay back
Looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap
I'm crying and shit
I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him

Even if a slug hit him
I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him
Can't control them pains
Now its time to throw them things

Visions of the stud don't stay
Empty the clip of am out right
Ambulance come around
By the time the hypes

Taking of his nikes
I know it sound cold
But this bullet put a hole in my soul
Never shorties years stole

He was only 17 years old
And at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll
And I know he used to wild sometimes
Carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine

No more reminiscing on the fun times
Balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines
But this nigga ain't going to want mine
For the pain I'm a handle this funk and dismantle this junk

Fuck all that
In all black and then pumped
To run up on this nigga
Tip up on him then jump

Mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
Eyes gleam with the fury
Never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers
In front of a prosecuting team and a jury

How did one murder turn into 2
Revenge had me shooting through hate
I couldn't stop
In the mist of the action

Is when that little ? got shot
All because of my motive for murder

[Chorus]

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who, yeah

Well we just met but girl there's something that I like
I'll get right to the point, I will not waste your time, I said,
I'd like to get to know you inside out and backwards, then I'll know

I like your smile but I love the way you laugh
I keep on thinking that I know you from my past, I said,
I'm giving what you need
Well I should gain control but I can't stop thinking

Girl I wanna drink from your cup
You got me goin' girl, I can't get enough
Wanna taste you on my lips, girl I'm in lust
You got me goin', you got me goin'

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who, yeah

I like the way you talk, I love the words you choose
You keep surprising me with all your thoughts and views, I think,
Is she too good to be true?
Cause I don't think I ever met a girl like you

And I won't wait or waste your time
And I'll tell you what's on my mind
I need you and you need me
Well I am here to fulfill all your needs

Girl I wanna drink from your cup
You got me goin' girl, I can't get enough
Wanna taste you on my lips, girl I'm in lust
You got me goin', you got me goin'

No ulterior motives, all my focus on you
Well I can't hide the way I'm feeling girl
Who's kidding who

Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big moneyin' to most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothin' is figurative
I can wish it into existence, god want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, "Nas did this"
Pointin' to they scars like, "right here, baby, really Nas did this"
Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap jack dempsey, matte black bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, passin' 'round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensary
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

Yo, what we talkin' 'bout niggas?
What we talkin' 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, nasty, what, recollect, fucker

At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'
Integrity intact, reppin' hard
They askin' how he disappear and reappear back on top
Sayin', "Nas must have naked pictures of god or somethin'"
To keep winnin' is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathin', I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like trump bein' up down up, play with cash

My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to bushwick
Harlem, bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?

At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felissimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot
Staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reachin', soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin'
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beastin'
Lookin' for the juks young, but now we older chiefin'
In my truck, play the greatest adventures of slick rick
Buggin' on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol agin' my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I? must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

This for my trapped in the 90's niggas
For my trapped in the 90's niggas
Ha, for y'all niggas

42nd street terminal

Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big money and the most
Uninhibited freak to sleep with

I was too proud to call you that night
I couldn't run, I know running gets old in a way
You sure know how to make or break a day
Well, you just fled the scene, so out of reach

You think a lot about yourself so much
For someone who relies on someone else's trust
I cower to your touch, you think I'd be the one to let go
So carry on

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah

This jealousy can't hold me over
I can't get mad, you know that anger gets all in your way
My jealous mind, it hates it but takes it
Those haunting memories are laced with secrets

Although I'm hard pressed and back from a fight
You think that this would end soon but it's taking its time
Confusion it is such an all time bad written melody
Of course you'd sing, please carry on

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah

Ask about her ways and her secret life
She'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask her if she thinks she can sleep at night
She'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask about her ways and her secret life
Ask her if she thinks she can sleep at night

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet

Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah

She's in love, she's in love
(She's in love, she's in love)
She's in love, she's in love
(She's in love, she's in love)
She's in love, she don't love you no more
She's in love with her motive, yeah

We've got unfinished business you and I
Yeah, something is stalking your head
Find, tear it down, inhale it's prophecy
Release the steel that lies behind the seal

You need this, c'mon and stand on your own two feet
You've dreamt it, make it real
You're the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
You're the love, true love at the midnight hour

Steady as a rock, smiling with blood on my hands
It feels so good watching the wasteland grow
Yeah, it pounds my head real hard, you're right my love
This sweet pain makes me do it no other way

You need this, c'mon and stand on your own two feet
You've dreamt it, make it real
You're the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
You're the love, true love at the midnight hour

The midnight hour
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight, the midnight hour

Yeah, with no apparent motive I snatch the lives of you
Good deed immunity, a madman living his dream

With only death in mind I make you disappear
And as I ride the universe no one conquers my fall

I need this, c'mon see me stand on my own two feet
I've dreamt it, now it's real
I'm the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
I'm the love, true love at the midnight hour

The midnight hour

Love and hate 'til death do us part

From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

I've seen places, faces
And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say "No"

To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I'd fly to you
From Russia with love

When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

Big black train coming round the bend
Go on kin folk tell your mom and them

Chugg a lugga, chugg a lugga, chugg a lugga
Who? The big black neck commin' through to you boy you done fell and bumped you head, uh huh
That's what they said
People say it's impossible, not probable, too radical
But I already been on the CMA's
Hell Tim McGraw said he liked the change
That he likes the way my hick-hop sounds and the way the crowd screams when I stomp the ground
Now, big and black, clickty-clack and I make the train jump the track like that

I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Yeah

From my deep decent deep into your ear
My voice is your choice that you wanted to hear
Southern boy makin' noise where the buffalo roam
Less denim an' bone that you might have known
See me ridin' into town like a desperado
With a big belt buckle
The cowboy bravado
All over the World Wide Web you'll see download CBT on that MP3
Speak clearly what I'm sayin' so you comprehend in the name of hick-hop radio tune in
Rollin' like thunder on to the scene
It's kinda hard to describe if you know what I mean
I never claimed to be the hardest of the brother's hard rock
But I'm booming out the box
Skills got you jumping out your socks
From Texas here I come movin' your body with the bass kick drum

I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Yeah

I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train, train
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Yeah

Huh, yea, one time
Get you some of that

Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!

Well we enter the facility, the place is jumpin'
Everything is crowded, the music is bumpin'
We make a lap with drink in hand
Try to walk around but we're in demand
About then sweety went to the ladies room
And that's when the DJ played the boom
Boom, boom, bang-biggity-bang
I looked over my shoulder and I was like "Dang!"
A chick was dancin' on the bar so I double checked
Sweety came back, something wrong with your head?
I said,


Like the fellas on the beach in the summertime
Checkin' out the girls walkin' up and down the coastline
Splashin' in the surf in their bikinis
Others tan on a blanket while they sip martinis
All winter long fellas did those crunches
'Cause girls are like bananas, man, they roll in bunches
Lookin' for fun but didn't keep it in check
What happened to you boy? I got a crick in my neck!


Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
You're hanging on my words like a life preserver
My rhyme is your table and I'll be your server
Paid attention to the song like a record exec
Bobbed your head up and down and got a crick in your neck!





Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

Well, I'm three weeks late on my credit card payment
The lady on the phone said she wants to make arrangements
"Put a little down, Can you pay a little on it?"
My wallet's too flat, couldn't pay if I wanted
They're callin' on my job, I'm gettin' letters in the mail
The haters in the hood all hopin' that I fail
My pocket's on Slimfast, tank on empty
Used to have friends said they wanna stick with me
Dogs in my stomach, 'cause now I'm getting hungry
Really under pressure wanna talk to my mommy
People on the corner askin' me for change?!
Gotta find me a job with a higher pay range
I've gotta tough time trying to pay my bills
If I hit the jackpot, that'll cure my ills
My credit is a joke and the banks ain't lendin'
Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin' (What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
The dang landlord's knockin' on my front door
Said he wants the rent from two weeks before
I want to make a call, huh I can't use the phone
That was late too, couldn't get a dial tone
Got snow on my TV, no mo' cable
Gotta use my strats, keepin' food on my table
My car note overdue, the bank's talkin' repo
Gotta take my girl to the matinee show
I'm makin' sure she takes a purse big as a tent
Sneakin' in candy bars for 89 cents
I take her to the buffet later in the evenin'
All you can eat, gotta maximize your feedin'
Gotta tough time trying to pay my bills
If I hit the jackpot that'll cure my ills
My credit is a joke and the banks ain't lendin'
Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Sho' nuff!)

See we live in a world of false pretense
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
My credit is a joke, the banks ain't lendin'
I ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'
Livin' in a world of false pretense
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
My credit is a joke, the banks ain't lendin'
I ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')

Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

[Verse 1]
Escuchen a la musica, the beat is groovin' ya
Groovin' with the record in secreto why la publica
It's the Cowboy with the fresh genre
The groove kinda smooth, make it wanna stick on ya
Comin' outta Dallas, puro eastside
Listen to this song as you're rollin' in your ride
Bumpin' up the street in your clean Impala
Suckers get mad, make 'em wanna holla
I'm the one who's preferred when you're makin' your selection
The verbal disinfectant just to guard against infection
I'm servin' everybody with a lyrical feast
I'm not John Travolta but I'm slicker than grease
On the floor that the janitor just quit moppin'
Maintain focus so there ain't no stoppin'
Stay unified everybody hick-hoppin'
And like whipped cream I'm gonna be chart toppin'

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, aw yeah, hit you with the beat that'll straighten your hair
Orale a mis carnales, puro tejano cowboy from Dallas
Uh-huh, aw yeah, hit you with the beat that'll straighten your hair
Orale a mis carnales, puro tejano cowboy from Dallas

[Verse 2]
Aw yeah, El Tejano no chavala
Esta cancion esta garantizada
The Texican is gonna flex again
Gonna put that rhyme in your chest again
Am I representin' (True that!!)
(Come on Troy, do that!!)
All up in your area, people sayin' (who dat?!)
Pongan atencion por este tipo de cancion
Why todas los ratones no tienen corazon
You try to say es imposible
Believe me for sheezy es incredible
No comprendes tu no entiendes
You try to understand it but you cannot defend this!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Latin Interlude]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Cowboy Troy]
Uh-huh, aw yeah!
Uh-huh, aw yeah!
Uh-huh, aw yeah!
Uh-huh, aw yeah!

Like dust in the wind sand slips through your fingers
Similar to shattered dreams that still linger
Trying to succeed in whatever you do
But the failures of the past seem to laugh and mock you

I'm worse than a has been 'cause you say I never will be
I'm just tryin' to excel so you feel me
'Cause boundaries are made to be broken
And I'm leavin' all the name sayers chokin'

On the dust that I'm kickin' up behind me
It's difficult findin' words to define me
The hick hop cowboy from the D A double L A S
So fresh in the contest

Rockin' stages like Guns N' Roses
I been flowin' since Madonna was strikin' poses
I can't quit now 'cause there's too much buzz
And I'm gettin' my chance because

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you and smilin' on me

I remember the days sittin' in the pews
When I heard the preacher sayin', "Spread the news"
I was feelin' the blues 'til I had a chance to choose
Now I feel the love to the soles of my shoes

Try to walk in a path of the guiding light
I thank the Lord for everything when I pray at night
'Cause I can feel His strength, I can feel His power
He's the one I turn to in my darkest hour

Try to be a good man, never called a saint
Never walked on water so I know I ain't
I might swim in the whiskey
But I'm bathed in the blood of the lamb

If you want peace raise your hand
And when Heaven comes, it won't be no drama
And if you see her first say, "Hi" to my Mama

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you, He's smilin' on me

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you

Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Somebody's smilin' on me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you, He's smilin' on me

In a smoky room, I see you
And you're dancin' to a groovin' tune
Just mellow out, shake your, mmm
And do your thang, baby do your thang

You gotta blonde, a redhead, a brunette
In the gym working up a sweat
One on the treadmill, one on the bike
One in kickboxing class all night
Doing their best to work it out
Tryin' to get a nice body and a nice "Badow"
You love to hear words comin' out of their mouths
These girls are G.R.I.T.S., 'Girls Raised In The South'

Gonna get cleaned up, meet at the spot
Each one is confident she's pretty hot
Hate to see them go but you love to watch them leave
Go on ladies just do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

The witching hour and the club is packed
And we're doing it and we're doing it fast
The lights are bright, cocktails strong
Just do your thang, baby do your thang

Man look at that face, silhouette body
Kickin' so hard you thought she knew karate
Send a 'Thank you' to her dad and mom
'Cause once she smiles boy you know what's on
You know she has nice etiquette
But she'll laugh even though she doesn't get it yet
You want to hear her say no one can do it better
Next she's callin' out the 15th letter

Better recognize, get woke to some act rights
She'll get to the point like stalagmites
Bouncin' in the club in the black light
Girl so fine bow down like a jack-knife
She ain't frontin', she ain't stuntin'
Swingin' for the fence boy, she ain't buntin'
She's educated but she's fluent in street slang
Go on girl, just do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Early in the mornin', I'm up and I'm out
Hopin' one day my album goes platinum
Rockin' that mic so viciously
Deliciously, not maliciously

When atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure converge
There's a party surge, so I must emerge
Get the people hyped and keep going nonstop
Knock the party off the meter when the bass line drops

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Ichi-nichi-ju, Ichi-nichi-ju
Kuroi Amerikajin yoru

The last of the Brohicans is speakin'
The one that you turn to each and every weekend
Risin', peakin' while the bump is beatin'
Don't turn back, no retreatin'

You can see my vision, you can feel my force
Time to hit the trail, boy, the mic is my horse
I tantalize and tickle your tympanic with my English
Smile as you listen to the ruckus

As I bring this mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Ichi-nichi-ju, Ichi-nichi-ju
Kuroi Amerikajin yoru
All day long, all day long
Cowboy Troy bringin' you this song
All day long, all day long
Cowboy Troy bringin' you this song

I'm comin' with the best and fresh from out west
Bus driver takin' you to school to pass the test
See, I'm lyrically hypnotic, at times even psychotic
Neurotic, bionic and it may leave you catatonic

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

The street is cold, the dawn is grey
My heart says no but my head says stay
My work is finished, or so I've been told
Can't part the three of us, once we got a hold

I forgot the name
I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
Tell by the shape I'm in

In line of fire, you know what to say
They gave us no choices, just one shade of grey
My legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray
But I know each step we take, they're one step away

I found the secret, the key to the vault
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all

I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said

I find my own fun,
Sometimes for free I got to pay it to come lookin' for me
Walkin' on Gucci,
Wearin' Yves St. Laurent barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt

I, I saw you there, wanted you there
I, I knew that it was best for me
You brought me back to that place in my heart
I thought was gone, oh so long
I was unhappy now it's gone
And I'm moving on, moving on
I'm moving on

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

Pass the evening, bring tomorrow
How could we know that night would bring us into daylight
Combination all around us
Fill our heads with the love we've been feeling
For time long past

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

All the time, darling now, oh
All the time, now we'll have to make it up
We'll make it up, oh
All the days, darling now, oh
All the days, now we'll have to make them up
We'll make them up somehow
We'll make them up

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

I've got a secret combination
I'm gonna use it to lock away your love
I've got a standing obligation
Never to change it 'cause then I?d lose your love

All the girls in town are trying
To get on your good side
They don't know that you ain't buying
Now matter how they try, I know they'll never find out

My secret combination
(Secret combination)
I'm gonna use it to lock away your love
I've got a standing obligation
Never to change it 'cause then I?d lose your love

I've got a secret, yeah, yeah
Ain't gonna let it out, no, no
I've got a secret

Two people together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you

Tomorrow forever
We both had these promises for far too long
But now you make the words come true

So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can make me feel this way

[Chorus]
You and me
We are the right combination
For love (for love), we're all we need (oh)
It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key

Can't keep it a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you

You hold me, it's magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do

Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there

[Chorus]

And whenever you call I'm there
Every stairwell to fall I share
I'll be yours till we love I care about you, baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me belong
I'll be by your side forever

[Chorus]

I've been thinkin' too much, I've been drinkin' too much
And thinkin' and drinkin' for me is a dangerous combination
And I'm lonely as hell, with a story to tell
I'm talkin' to myself and that's a dangerous conversation

Baby, you could save me tonight
You could make everything alright
You're lookin' better by the minute
I'm tryin' to keep from falling in it

But you may be just a little too much temptation
If we're gonna turn back, better turn back now
I'd say no, but I don't know how
Girl, I really should be leaving
But that's another conversation
Baby, you and me tonight is a dangerous combination

I've been trying so hard, feel like crying so hard
Baby, I may die trying to find a taste of sweet salvation
But it all looks so clear through these glasses of beer
And in your eyes, I've stumbled upon a double shot of inspiration
A rock and a hard place, I'm in between
Come on, baby, and set me free

But you may be just a little too much temptation
If we're gonna turn back, better turn back now
I'd say no, but I don't know how
Girl, I really should be leaving
But that's another conversation
Baby, you and me tonight is a dangerous combination

Tell me does he ever stroke your body gently
Does he talk to you the way that I do
Does he look into your eyes and see his future
I know that I do when I'm loving you

He's been treating you like love is out of season
Girl there ain't no reason
You can have it all
What a woman needs

[Chorus]
This is how my heart beats
When I am making love to you
Listen to the sounds of how much I want you
Let your body feel my groove
I wanna get deep in you
This is what a woman needs day and night
What a woman needs

You need understanding love and devotion
So let me put it into motion
This is what I'll do for you

I'll break you off the way that you like
I'll be the priest you call in the night
I'll keep it real
So baby what's the deal

He's been treating you like love is out of season
Girl there ain't no reason
You can have it all
What a woman needs

[Chorus]

Everyday will be sunshine
'Cause what a woman needs
I'll give to you
Making love in the moonlight
I promise I will cherish you forever

[Chorus]

It seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I've missed you (miss you too)

[Chorus]
'Cause you you and I back together again
We got the world in a spin
'Cause you you and I back together again,
We got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
I'm here heart in hand
You take all that I got if you need it baby

[Chorus]

Love will last forever (that's true)
We can make it real (got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never
We can truly feel (watcha feel) (I feel like getting)

Back together
(Baby keep it real and I will be there till the end)

Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle here to stay (here to stay)
(We got the world)

[Chorus]

You know the deal
My life story from broke
We always talked about the bad times that turned into jokes
We spoke about you leaving the town, yo I was down
But now you're back in my life
I'm happy to have you around (I hold you down)
Remember the fun we have when we're young
You thought it was done, never none
We haven't begun
Together we come the land of living
I'm giving my heart to you every part
You the one I'm feeling

Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
It's so easy to do when you care

[Chorus]

Eh Maxi Priest a wha she a do
Seems she want to dance with the crew
She wants to dance all night
A what she a try
Look like she wants to mad the I

Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance do you wanna
Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance

Moving in cheek to cheek
Still in silence we don't speak
So intense in the groove
All she wants is to get rude
Rising up to the heat
I get chills down to my feet
When I'm begging her to stay
She just turns and says no way

[Chorus]
She likes to dance
She just a mad the up the crew
She doesn't want a romance
So tell me what to a do
She wants to tease
Eh eh Baby Boo
She's got a passion to please you
Weh you a do Poochie Lou
She wants to dance
She just a mad the up the crew
Just to give you the fever
So tell me what to a do
Just like an addiction
You just want it more and more

Sexy dress makes you dess
Leaves you yearning to caress
While she's burning like a fire
You're just melting with desire
You can look but you can't touch
And you just won't get too much
She's not into conversation
You won't get no explanation

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance do you wanna
Oh oh oh do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance

Yow she leave we body a heat up
And we heart it a beat up
Degree knees weak up
Maxi Priest catch hiccup
What is on my mind
A me and her have to meet up
On her case an we naah give it up
Caah this here woman not easy
A wine how she a gwaan me just can't believe it
Excitement create wid every look she please we
Naah stop tease we

Like a fruit to tempt your taste
Pure excitement to her waist
Now you're fixed in a spell
Good or evil you can't tell

[Chorus x2]

Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise

To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
And I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it

[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance ooh
Oh just to hold your hand

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flowers grow
Oh into a lovely smile that's bloomin'
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true
And there's no way that I'll be losing you oh

[Chorus]

Oh baby baby baby

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flowers grow
Oh into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing you oh

[Chorus]

Oh take me right away
Take me right away
Just take me right away
Oh I wanna go there
I wanna go there

Walk away, just walk away

Eight o'clock, the purple clouds
I look outside my heart is heavy with regret
I never thought I could be standing so empty
And now your face I know I never will forget

They say this is love
And you go through things like this sometimes
Try and not to show, oh no
You know I know that it's over but I just can't let it go
And now that I know

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

Twilight, sun going down
The atmosphere is of romance is in the air
Reaching out for a piece of a memory
Final moments of our love we could share

But too many things undecided in between us
A life time and a day, oh yeah
Ooh, don't break the silence that surrounds us
'Cause there's nothing more to say and we'll have to pay

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

They say this is love
And you go through things like this sometimes
That's the way it goes oh no
I got so much emotion but I just can't let it go
No, no, no

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

It wasn't meant to be between you and me
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
I've seen now the road I've been going down
Wasn't meant to be, no, no

Don't rush the move you gotta make
Don't give it all before you take
Just step aside and watch a while
Be prepared to walk an extra mile
Flip the switch and check the groove
And now's the time to stop talk and move
Education is the only way
To learn to live to fight another day

[Chorus]
We can make it if we try try try
Who's the mathematician Jah Jah on a mission try try try

Don't get caught in no desperation
Use your skill from your ghetto irration
Feel the vibration
Some people see it astrologically
But I didn't get that from my triga knowledgy

What a friend who would deceive
Use your faith when you believe
Thought he was a friend
The human love we thought was real
So off and on so what's the deal
Thought he was a friend yeah

[Chorus]

Now tell me
Who's the mathematician
Jah Jah on a mission
Trying to find a way in this world of attrition
Jah Jah on a mission
Work it out,work it out

Keep it real

We gotta find a sanctuary
Flip into the 21st century
Keep it real and lose the fakes
Learn all your lessons from your own mistakes
Children now will come of age
Let's keep the love as we set the stage
Justice for all we can stand tall
No more comin' from back against the wall hey

We can make it if we try try try
Who's the mathematician
Jah Jah on a mission

If love was a thing that money could buy
The rich would live and the poor would die yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I only have one heart
Don't tear it all apart
I don't know where to start
Cause I can't wait forever for you

The way you treat me baby
I just don't understand
The way you hold my hand
I thought I was your man
And all the things I wanted
And all that we've been through
I've never loved no one the way that I loved you

So why you treat me so bad
I almost go mad
I wouldn't do the things that you do
Now I'm sad
I thought I had you
Now it's an impossible dream that will never come true yeah

[Chorus]

Some things I hear you say
It just don't go that way
The things I see you do
Ooh what happen to you
So tell me what went wrong

I guess I had it wrong
Tell me what's going on

'Cause now I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
Girl if you don't want me
Set me free for a love
That's waiting for me
There's got to be a better way
And someone who really loves me

[Chorus]

Nanananana, nanananana I can't wait for you no way no way
Nanananana, nanananana I can't wait for you no way

I only have, have one heart
I only got one heart
I only have, have one heart
I don't know where to start
'Cause I can't wait forever for you

If love was a thing that money could buy
The rich would live and the poor would die

The minute I saw you
I wanted to hold you
But I kept it inside and my foolish pride
I wish that I'd told you

Why can't you be mine
And spend all of my time
I've so much to give and one life to live
I can't be without you

[Chorus]
If only I could be the one
To love you forever
If only I could be the one
To cherish forever

Don't know if we're coming or going
I just don't know what to do
And so scared to walk away without knowing ooh

What can I tell you
I just can't ignore you
Could I be the one, just let me be the one
Someone you can run to

[Chorus]

Too many words left unspoken, spoken
Girl I promise you your heart won't be broken no no
If you're looking for some love and affection
Then you're looking in the right direction

I wanna cherish you cherish you baby
Anyway you want me to
Cherish you, cherish you darling
For the rest of my life
Cherish you baby ooh yes I will

[Chorus x3]

When did you realize that addiction was your life?
The first time I pushed it through my veins.
The hug it gave me, I never experienced in my life. It wouldn't let me go

Writings on the wall but I can't see the words
It's, right in front of me but my vision is blurred
And, Is this love that makes the clear eye blurred?
Is this love that has me losing my mind

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'm a call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
'Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins

Now I can't live without him cause he's all that I breathe
I don't hang out much cause he's all that I need
This crazy intoxicating kind of feel
One day might be the death of me, oh

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'm a call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
'Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins

Hit it once, feels so good, hurt so bad, had enough
Pull me back, tear me out, fuck me up
I never know, at least we go together babe
(Just stay with me and It'll only love [?])
Forget about your worries, live it out like we're young
'Cause life's too short not to have fun
You be holding it down
Knock a couple more rounds
That feel good pain while you're running through my, my

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'm a call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
'Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins

It's easy to be persuaded
It's easy because I'm weak
If it were me I wouldn't make it
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Frequently sedated
Beast in my veins
If it's free I'm gonna take it
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Now I've got you

Goodbye my sad and lonely
Goodbye that love it's sick for me

Marked as a "new human breed", with the face ripped from the amorphic body,
Half breathing to not disturb this order.
Wired to a demo-god, upgrading the faith, downloading the holy soul-ware.
Saved or just safe?
Data flooding a weak brain, confused mind under mass media control,
Submissively taking the nourishment until it pukes with cybernetic dope.

New age has come, shiny screens display the true world.
How many bytes are You worth?
You get a "sweet" and it does the trick.
Be a clown or get the throne through knowing "more"?

Mental extermination machines, pumping shit into the brains.
Global factories mass-producing the new kind of man.
The numbered model scalped of identity, steered and deafened.
I cut the wires, I wrestle with the veins.
Must disconnect!

Millions of clones, humanoidal folk, being bred and dying,
Suffering the same kind of dole.
Touching the throne, the invisible throne, are the kings of lethargy
Chained to the fake crown.
Serving the gods, the digital gods, on the altar of stripped privacy.
Fucking system's sluts!

Vain, let's go
Let's welcome everybody to planet pit
And show 'em what worldwide music is

They call me Mr. Worldwide
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me, Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up 'cause,  now worldwide

When you become involved in the music business
But the funny thing is that half these fools don't know music
Don't know business, have no business in music, what is this?

I learned from the best, stayed away from the worst
Now I send off every verse in a hearse
Now every day is fifteenth and the first
No more food stamps, church

You boys can't get passed third base
Mad about your MC searchin'
I couldn't care less and couldn't give a fat baby's ass
If the car's got curtains

So they reap for the block
I speak to the globe, I got the model ?
Better do your homework papito
I took the 305 worldwide

Well I took the 305 worldwide

Why you think they call me, Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me, Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up 'cause I am worldwide

So far from you; other side of the wall
There's a bottomless cry that is spinning
Interdimensional, hidden inside
Of these lights which I seem to be missing

Marching ahead to silent beats
Bumping into these dead machines
You can hear everything with me
You can win everyone but me

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
I don't

Don't think I'll talk
Yeah I don't think I'll breathe
And I don't think I'll think
What you're thinking

All that I know of us is what was there
In the longest of stares we were sinking
Ashes to beauty; rust in lust
Passion attempts; misguided trust
Smoking your bag of trickery
Getting to love the little beast

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
I don't

In this wading pool
In this waiting room
I elevate us down

In a neglected olive tree
Here is the part you reach for me
Say that you have no need of this
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Again again again

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Who knows?
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
No Glow from above our heads
Nothing there to see you down on your knees
Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven
(Twenty years in the future)
Off in the future maybe there ain't no heaven
It's just you and me and maybe it's just as well
'Cause if there ain't no heaven maybe there ain't no hell?
Who knows?
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
Who knows?

Oh the veins of her Majesty the Queen
They're so regal and serene
How I'd love to say I'd been
Down the veins of her Majesty the Queen
Tunnel down their beauteous sheen
And tell everything I'd seen
Oh the Queen (Oh yes the Queen)
And her cellar full of dogs
(And all her dogs)
Wonder has she any frogs?
(Oh, has she frogs?)
Does she ever chop up logs?
(Or chop up logs?)
Whoa oh no (Oh, no Oh, no)
No, I don't suppose she does
(I don't suppose she does)
It would all be too much fuss
Anyway, she'd have a

Private detective with her
Private detective with her

Just making sure no one ever had a go
At her Majesty the Queen
Someone no one really knows
You might think you know your friends
(Oh, you might think you know your friends)
Even when they're on a screen
Yeah, but nobody pretends
(But nobody pretends)
That they really know the Queen
(They really know the Queen)
So I'd love to say I'd been
Somewhere deep inside
The veins of her Majesty the Queen

I see him standing silhouetted in the lamp-light
I cross the street and I quicken my pace
He cups his hands and he lights a cigarette
I find myself in the bones of his face

It's just the night in my veins, oh!
Making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night
Under my skin, slipping it in

He's got his hands in my hair and his lips everywhere
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

He's got me up against the back of a pick-up truck
Out of sight of the neon and glare
We might as well be on a beach under the moonlight
Love's language reads the same anywhere, yeah

It's just the night in my veins, oh!
Making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night
Under my skin, slipping it in

He's got his chest on my back across a new Cadillac
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

I've got my head on the curb and I can't produce a word
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

Take off my nothing inside
Take off my nothing inside
Green green green green
Temple, green, your simple guide
Bubble back in young beat
Glad, their rights
And this the far and
The quite time
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it

Fake it, green, take it, green,
Leave it, green, feel it,

Green, green, it's green they say
On the far side of the hill
Green, green, I'm going away
To where the grass is greener still

Ah well I told my mama on the day I was born
Don't you cry when you see I'm gone
Ya know there ain't no woman gonna settle me down
I just gotta be traveling on
Singing

[CHORUS]

Nah, there ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Gonna tell me to spend my time
I'm just a good-loving rambling man
Say, buddy, can ya spare me a dime?
Hear me crying, it's a

[CHORUS]

Yeah, I don't care when the sun goes down
Where I lay my weary head
Green, green valley or rocky road
It's there I'm gonna make my bed
Easy, now

[CHORUS]

Everybody, I want to hear it now

To where the grass is greener still
To where the grass is greener still

To where the grass is greener still

Look Out !

People used to call me backwards,
Living out here with the tractors,
Letting this world leave me behind.
Now-a-days I'm an innovator
I'm a country boy prognosticator
I'm a man ahead of my times

I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love,
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing

Sheets on the clothes line drying
Red Tail hawks a flying
A couple of deer on the timber line
And I know a lot more about cane pole fishing
then I ever will know about carbon emission
And my little corner of the world is doing just fine

I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans
I've got a guitar I play unplugged

And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing

Yeah, I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of root baked potatos and greens
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love,
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing
I was green before green was a thing

Oh yeah.

Amy
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely even know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
For a bunch of fools drown in shame
Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs
But it never really kept you safe
You're too young for the golden age
Cause the record bin's been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are you eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep

the Green Hornet!

You opened the door,
I let myself in.
Between you and me,
I only believe
What I want to believe.
I guess it's because I'm
Greener than green.
Only because I'm green.
Only because I'm green.

I came up to your floor
You were dressed
Just a little obscene.
And it shut me down
Quite sexually
Like a pre-adolescent
because I'm greener than green.

Only because greener then green.
Only because I'm green.

We like to spy on the neighbors.
They look so happy together.
Funny the power of strangers.
Sometimes I wonder if they got it better.
Green. Have you seen green?
Check out the view from the rooftop.
They've got a horse and a big trampoline.
Running and jumping till they drop.
Down on the ground and they're rolling around in... green.
Have you seen green?
Have you seen green grass?
So green, grass.
So green.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be moving on a lawn, so green.
I want to laugh the way they laugh.
See all my blues get back up in the sky.
If only we had what they had.
We'd never worry and we'd never cry for, green.
Have you seen green?
Have you seen grass?
So green, grass.
So green.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be like that.
I'd like to be moving on a lawn, so green.

Now, May and I were two children just swimming in a pool
We'd ride on rockets, swing-sets and we tried to touch the moon
And I will never forget the first time she touched my hand
I knew this could be the one who would make me an honest man

She was like the way she was
She was like the way she was

Now, we got older faster than we ever could have seen
Lights went down on graduation then on a wedding ring
We bought our first house and had a baby on the way
But during birth, I got my daughter
Jesus took away my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
When you looked into her eyes you'd come undone
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

Now, baby girls love daddy most
But they need a mother's care
I tried my best to raise her right
I just couldn't braid her hair
One day she got old enough to have her wedding day
But as I walked her down the aisle
All I could see was my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
When you looked into her eyes you'd see the sun
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

But May, I hope you can see what I see
'Cause when they talk about our baby girl they think of you
And they say to me

She's just like she was
When I looked into her eyes I'd see the sun
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And doesn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

She was just like she was
When I looked into her eyes I'd come undone
She was just like she was
And I cannot feel my heart beat
Without the thought of her inside me
She was like she was

We strolled along through the heaven
And it was June, June on the Isle of May
Your lips were sweet as the heaven
Love was in bloom there on the Isle of May

Cause in your arms heaven opened its door
Then like a fool I sailed away
But our love will bring us together
When it is June, June on the Isle of May

I see that worried look upon your face
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

Now just like you, I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

She used to love me, that I know
And it don't seem so long ago

That we were walking
And we were talking
The way that lovers do

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

And so forgive me if I seem unkind (I ain't got no pity for you)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine (I lost, I lost, I lost my little girl
Too)
I'd help another place, another time
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You've got your troubles, I've got mine.

Strangers in the night,
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night,
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.

How gentle is the rain, that falls softly on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

How gentle is the rain, that falls gently on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me;
And if your love is true, ev'rything will be just as wonderful.

You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me;

Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore

The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love

There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

Say it isn't so
Say it isn't so.
Everyone is saying you don't love me,
Say it isn't so.

Everywhere I go,
Everyone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,
Say it isn't so.

People say that you
Found somebody new,
And it won't be long before you leave me,
Say it isn't true.

Say that everything is still okay,
That's all I want to know.
And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.

People say passing by
Say he's younger than i
And it won't be long before you leave me,
Tell me it's a lie.

Say that everything is still okay,
That's all I want to know.
And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

(Come on and) dance with me
I want my arms about you
That those charms about you
Will carry me through

(Right up) to heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)

Out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh once I had a little dog, his color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,
Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, "My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine"

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too.
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear,
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Ring around the rosy
And I'll catch you if I can
And if you don't say may I,
Then you'll have to start again
But first you must indulge me
And count from one to ten
Let the game begin

I adore you when you touch me
Pin the tail upon the donkey,
You will surely win
And if you don't say may I,
Then I'll pass the cake around
And I won't give you any,
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat soap, anyhow

Red light, green light,
Blue light, yellow light
You can take three giant steps
Or a baby step will do
But if you don't say may I,
Then I'll march you out the door
Where you'll be contemplating
The numbers one to four
I hope you're keeping score

'Cause if you don't say may I,
Then I'll get you with the hose
And spoil your Sunday clothes
Will it please you if I tease you
While you're at the spindry,
I'll pass the pie around
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat blackbird anyhow

There's four and twenty reasons
Why it can't be wrong
How long have you been gone
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers

Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,

Yo, Step into reality, it's a cold cold world
You got to learn to accept it, feels like I've been neglected
All these bands coming out and they sound alright
All these videos on tv and they look alright
I spent my whole life spilling my guts between the lines
Putting in more work than you will ever know than when I rhyme
Tryin to press the people so I can reach the masses
Give them what they want with this pen that's plastic (Life)
I got a message I'm a put it in a bottle
Sign the bottom of the paper and let the whole world swallow
Today can be tomorrow, ain't no telling when I'm leaving
I'm a rock this microphone even when I'm barely breathin'
When you start sleepin, D-loc starts creepin
When you actin a fool, D-loc's always thinking
Be clever when you play me because it's comin back to hull
I can feel my heats rising and it's pissin me off
And when it's pissin me off I got no choice
But to crack snap back at you like a chain reaction
I'm gettin older dog you better watch your mouth
You better think before you speak on the mic or get knocked out
It's been a minute and your shit better stop
Bring your punk ass back to Cali, bitch ass get popped
You ain't never in Cali, wonder why they don't accept you
Your sound's getten flopped, plus you got a fuckin attitude

Life
Life's a constant struggle

I was never really understood, had a lot of misunderstandings
Not too many saw my plan, so it left me standing in my own two shoes
Now what the fuck was I suppose to do?
Givin a fight, be a man or take my life
To make ends meet I did more wrongs than rights
Couldn't hold a job, I can't handle being bossed
In and out of rehabs, from border schools I was tossed
Started hanging with the wrong crowd
Caught slanging by my pops and got thrown out
On my own once again I had to make it happen
That's just a little of my life before I started rappin'
But I always kept in touch with my dog Dustin
That's the one friend that I never stopped trusting
Next thing you know I'm living over at his pad
Me and him and Saint we was workin for his dad
Drinkin tallboys after work every night
Takin hits in the garage out of metal pipes
Working long ass hours no 9 to 5
But you gotta do what it takes to survive
That's around the time that we met Daddy X
And ever since then we've been on a new quest
Kottonmouth was formed so it began a new chapter
Of my life that I'm livin til I'm in the after after

Life
Everybody has troubles
And everybody's troubles are different than others
Life's a constant struggle
But keep your head high and it'll be alright
Life
Everybody has troubles
And everybody's troubles are different than others
Life's a constant struggle
But keep your head high and it'll be alright

Life
Everybody has troubles
"Think about it"
Life's a constant struggle
"Think about it"
Life
Everybody has troubles
"Think about it" "Think about it" "Think about it"
Life's a constant struggle
But keep your head high
And it'll be alright
"Think about it"

Did you see me fall away?
At what point did fate crumble to the ground?
I thought I found something to last forever.
Holding on with desperate tears,
I was screaming but you could not seem to hear me cry and now, I surrender.

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast.
Better off leaving with these last times
So you?ll keep remembering me.
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you keep remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Tell me was it good for you?
Cause its what kept me glued to what I knew all along was going in the wrong direction.
I don't think I gave up too early.
I don't think life is long enough to go and waste it all on imperfection

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast
Better off leaving with these last times
So you'll keep remembering me
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you're still remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Running on empty always
I swim to the surface always
But the truth is always hard to take
In broken pieces

Better think of something fast
Better off leaving with these last times
So you'll keep remembering me
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you keep remembering me forever. Remember me forever.
You'll remember me.

Just one short life
No second chance
To make of ourselves what we can
The moving hands again advance
& mould me into what I am
Waiting, waiting
Well understood but not controlled
Forever here anonymous
What's present now
Already past
In retrospect so obvious
Waiting, waiting
Such a short space of time
But time passes quickly
Learn so little so slowly
As each moment is mine
The hope never fading
You will always be left waiting, waiting
Such a short space of time
Learn so little so slowly
As each moment is mine
You will always be left waiting

Growing apart you couldn't see
Your not the man I want to be
Stale mate time it was over
All the while destroying each other
One thing I'd like you to know
I want my own life so let me go
All the years obeying the rules
Your game of life is played by fools
Just let me go, just let me fo
I can't feel nothing for you
But what is left for me to do
No cause for concern, we live & we learn
I'll just say goodbye
Search deep I have to find
The truth that lurks within my mind
Your words you used to drown me
Are washed away I'm free to be
Just let me go, just let me go
I can't feel nothing for you
But what is left for me to do
No cause for concern, we live & we learn
I'll just say goodbye
Now we're apart can you see
I'm now the man I want to be
A second chance not that its over
We don't need to hate each other
I can't feel nothing for you
But what is left for me to do
No cause for concern, we live & we learn
I'll just say goodbye (Repeat 2X)

Another day, you've no concerns but the desire burns
Another day, for you to face your problem
Is that the way that you want to be ?
A constant liability
Another day, why can't you see what you are gonna be
Another day, will pass away unnoticed
Your remedy for peace and quiet
Constant intake liquid fire
Good intentions permanent again
Another crisis imminent again
Your worst side dominant again
Look at yourself again
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
What do you see ?
Everything revolves around the habit
Like it or not it is the bottom line
Hand to mouth a single reflex you are mine
Detached from being forget your problems
No misgivings are you happy now ?
Good intentions permanent again
Another crisis imminent again
Your worst side dominant again
Look at yourself again
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
What do you see ?

It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy

And losin' touch with all that's real
Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover

Iron lung I know you well
Deal with you like a bad spell
See the trail moon burns
Red Stripe and Vicadin
You were the only one
You're the censor
You'll never people me
I'm not defenseless
In the afternoon as the light dims
Build a life out of, of all this Semtex
You're the brightest one
You were the center
The perfect opposite of, of what you asked for

It's not just one way
A negative factor
With all of these wasps out
I'd better take cover
Better take cover

Copper tongue beam me up
Lonely without my impediments
Start to save what we used to steal
Walking on gelatin
I never noticed you
You were the brightest one
You were the wide of me
Just like the English sun
You caught the light again
In a perfect way
The biggest threat of all
Is in the alleyway
You're the demon seed
You're the factor
Feel better with a little bit of plaster

It's not just one way
A negative factor
With all of these wasps out
Better take cover
Better take cover
I'd better take cover

There's all the pain in the way she talks
All the pain in the way she walks
All the pain in her wave goodbye
All the pain in the way she smiles
All the pain in her fatal charm
All the pain in her arms
In her arms
In her arms
In her arms

Stuck in the learning hole,
There is no teaching
That I can subscribe to -
Just the hatred of being afraid.

Trapped in a nightmare,
Nothing can alter this.
Just another daydream,
Calendar sadness.

Lucid, inducing swarm
Becoming closer but getting colder.
The caustic grip insane.

Lucid induced
Pre-shaping destiny - hiding inside of me.
Primate illusions of
How all this should be.

Next of kin to chaos.

Forgive the prince for awaking rude
He heard footsteps near his head
Lady luck had made him proud
When he spends his stays in bed
Making love to the victories
Wives just paying for his head (?)
Today will outlive yesterday
As long as someone breaks the bread
He's his mamma's pride
He's his daddy's last heartbreak

Well the sunrise in the kingdom
Chicken's swooned to hear the man (?)
Some find their way onto the paintings
Others calling to the frying pan
And the farmer's wife wakes him with smiles,
Tender budging hands
Meat and wine for all as long as someone breaks the land
Meat and wine for all. long as someone breaks the land
He's got his mamma's eyes
He's got his daddy's younger hands

Sunset makes the shadows longer
But the tavern in the valley glows
Stars fly on the forest, hell,
There's a prince hanging out the window
The farmer's daughter rubs his neck
Her hands are strong from serving rum
Today gonna outlive yesterday
Tonight gonna outlive yesterday
Tonight might make for kingdoms to come
Kingdoms yet to come
Kingdoms yet to come

Every night without the light
Or brightly shining low
Silver trees and darkened leaves
Blot the sky above

As the yellow moon to the darkest night
Turns to raging fire
The road it bends and the darkness spins
To voices in the choir

I dream of horses and their kin
Against the lovely night
I dream of sand and sky and sin
Against the pale blue light

And everyone that feels at all
Has got something to say
About the way of southern ways
Of every wild day

There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?

There's a little child runnin' 'round this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done now
How did you go bad?

Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

You see, I'm all grown-up now
He said
Just put your feet down child
'Cause you're all grown-up now

Just like a photograph I pick you up
Just like a station on the radio
I pick you up
Just like a face in the crowd
I pick you up
Just like a feeling that you're sending out
I pick it up
But I can't let you go
If I let you go
You slip into the fog

This love was big enough for the both of us
This love of yours
Was big enough to be frightened of
It's deep and dark like the water was
The day I learned to swim

Just put your feet down child
Just put your feet down child
The water is only waist high
I'll let go of you gently
Then you can swim to me

Big enough to let go of me?
Without hurting me

We'll dig a hole in the ground
And cover it up with sticks
And chase a wooly mammoth in
And jab at it with our spears

The lady at the counter
With cold oatmeal eyes,
'Take a number', she said,
'They'll call you when they're ready for you.'

I was waiting for
My hunting with early man license
They said it costs one hundred bucks
Can you believe it?

We'll dig a hold in the ground
And cover it up with sticks
And chase a wooly mammoth in
And jab at it with our spears...

They said it cost one hundred bucks,
Can you believe it?

The lady at the counter
With cold oatmeal eyes!

We dropped the ball,
It rolled away,
Down a hill,
Onto the freeway,
We didn't look,
We got run over,
We died and rotted
We decomposed.
We became fuel
For future human
Flying cars
Our remains
Will quench their
Thirsty engines
They'll get gas
Or die trying...
We swallowed the olive, man, we blew it...
We Baptized our Super-Sized Babies in embalming fluid...
With squirt guns...

We dropped the ball
It rolled away
Behind the couch
It gathered dust
The soot of lives
We put our feet up
On the table
Which was embossed
With dead skin
The soot of lives
We were scared
We bought plastic
Furniture covers
And jogging suits
To protect us from the bulldozers

Jesus Christ is my American Idol!
He's the Brand New Funky President!
Victory is certain, this much is certain,
And if it's not you can always
Start the video game over....

Squirt Guns filled with pig's blood, for real

We're winning...

Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York
My baseball mitt collects dust on the floor of my car.
And I sort of secretly hope he's not there to stay...
But anyway...
I hope Sam's a famous actor one day...

Sometimes I dream I'm driving across the water
In a car with my dad or my brother...
Sometimes you dream you're in a foreign country
And you packed all the wrong clothes...

Cars up on the overpass
Fake the sound of waves
I can feel the building shaking
Pacing pacing pacing pacing

By the bedroom window
Spying dirty eating urban birds...
Picking myself apart
Waiting for you to get home from work...

Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York
I don't know what to do with do-nothing days
I suppose there's no such thing anymore anyway...
I suppose that's okay...

Cars up on the overpass
Fake the sound of waves
I can feel the building shaking
Pacing pacing pacing pacing

I will not hide inside
Bewilderment...

On a drizzling day
Monks and drums and cats
And our hats mussed our hair
And our shaking frames
Found their wedded way...

Different ways to learn
What you ought not not do-
Different paths to the same places...Edit as you go...
Life on the first take

Walking on guilelessness's sturdy stilts
Through guiltlessness's beaming streets

I'm a tiny Crab
In a tidal wave
I have no complaints
And I too have you
To complain about it to.

Walking on guilelessness's sturdy stilts
Through guiltlessness's beaming streets
To see you naked outdoors...
With Rousseau eyes

Erase erase erase
Silent explosions in space
Erase erase erase
Pure as the sun on your face

Erase erase erase
Until there ain't a trace
Pure as the sun on your face

One day I'll seethe with ether teeth...
One day we'll breathe a coelacanth tree...
One day history will be but a tickling breeze.

I'm a total wreck when you don't call
Fancy me a brand new Newton sitting
Under an anvil tree
Waiting for an anvil to fall

They call me Mr. It's A Big Deal
I don't ever go to movies
So when I go to movies
It's a pretty big fucking deal

Flop like a fish on a dock
Conk me with a frying pan to make me stop

Clothes in a dryer
Leaves in the breeze
One day a dump trunk will dump two tons of kittens on me

After dark
All bark no bite
At night
All bite no bark

We are warm where we are...
I am totally fucking prepared to declare nuclear war on every boy in every band...

Aw Crud, what a dud
A fuddy duddy
That's funny, that mummy

I hate you wall
I'm sorry wall
I didn't mean that at all.

A Maroon
With a harpoon
In a spitoon
In a saloon
A cartoon moon

The end of the movie reel- flap, flap flap
The wings of the pterandodon- flap, flap, flap
A big fat, pregnant, radish smiling
At the funniest pallbearer in the funeral.

The eye, a spoof of god.
The day, a crippled wolf.
Were you born to be a sprinkler system in a thunderstorm?

We can agree that we all like to look our best.
Or at the very least be the best at looking the worst.
It's no wonder that eventually we will all be on TV.

Woke up and smiled this morning
Wishes swam like fishes in my head
I rub my eyes as all the reasons chase the
Demons from my bed
I'm on top of the world
And it's just for a moment

I know all the right words
And I wish that I'd told you then
I know now, I know how
Come and splash in the waves and they'll kiss you with cold
'Till you shiver and say that you wish I would hold you
Well I know now

I know how
Woke up and smiled this morning
Wishes swam like fishes in my head
I rubbed my eyes as all the reasons chase the
Demons from my head
Open goals that call me over
I've got to take them
Don't fall over again

General guidelines to ride by
Can't kill my vibe, you couldn't find mine
Come to New York City, I'm in the skyline with a fine dime
And nigga we ain't fine dining
Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates
Hit the high line, that's a cheap date
I ain't worthy, fuck it who is?
Do what you do girl, fuck it you lit
Hundred niggas yelling "New York back"
I hear em rapping they only set, "New York back"
I'm in Queens to Harlem, the Garden I rap
And I'm only hearing New York clap
Bout to move out to Cali, got a little thing out the valley
And this one girl hiding my hookah
I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver
Truth, through the city like a presidential motorcade
On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake
Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A
Running with the same niggas since grade eight
You ain't never seen no strangers appear
My niggas been the same ones for years
I don't do it for the peers, I do it for the fam
Man, all of my angles are clear
Other day yo, I was shopping on Rodeo
Got a call from my nigga Cheyo
Said the hood hot bro
Gotta get away yo
Losing niggas like every day
Told 'em 18 months I'ma get a tour bus
Coming up and we never looking back
Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep
Three ducks in the truck like beep beep

Life is what you make of it, it's play-doh
This year, this year man goes back to the moon

If you coming to my city wanna know the deets?
I'm the embassy, I'm the one to see
Yeah baby, yeah baby
From over here but I took it over there baby
Riding in the drop, let your hair crazy
Climbing to the top going stair crazy
Crazy how the game opened up
A nigga ain't been home for some months
But when I get home I be posted up
Do it for the city til the coast is us
From a city where a nigga turn a penny to a twenty
But when the penny turns friends turn to enemies
As semis turn urns into memories
Make shots nigga burn like the Hennessy
The city got problems, the city's so godless
I watch it all burn like it's heresy
Witchcraft for your bitchass, witchcraft is your gift that
I live in the moment, the moment is timeless
I hear all your talk but you're so unaccomplished
Opinions are nonsense
And I ain't got time for opinions to process
These days I'm inspired by me and nothing else
Bottles of tequila and some weed and nothing else
You know my niggas with me and no one else
I ain't pressing you can hold them hoes, sudden death
Golden goals

You know where I come from
You know my story
You know why I'm standing here
Tonight
Please don't go
Don't be in a hurry

Make it right

Well I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more

Worth reaching for

You know that I need you

Live without you
Be without you

That we will be leaving together
So when I say I love you

Ever and ever

Tonight
Please don't go
Don't be in a hurry

Make it right

Well I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more

Live without you

Well I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more
No more

I'm not here to say I'm sorry
I'm not here to lie to you

If you want to sing
Then sing
If you want to run
Run away
It's all right to speak
Just watch what you say
Don't let the words
Get in your way
To achieve
All you've got to do is just believe
Come whatever, come what may, sing

I can't let my dreams slip away
I won't let my heart break
It doesn't matter what it takes
I'm reaching for my goal
I'm going on
If you're on the team
Come to play
Be the one
That sets the pace
Follow your dreams
Dream away
And your life
Will never be the same
To achieve
All you've got to do is just believe
Come whatever, come what may

[Chorus 2x]
With every passing day
Until I'm old and gray
I'm gonna do my thing
No matter what my so called friends might say
They can't put out my fire
I've got too much desire
I'm reaching for my goal
Can you help me, can you help me sing
Vamp out

I had me a wearied dream, seen me a wearied scene
When I seen what I saw, couldn't sit still
Nero was kissing on Buffalo Bill
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me

There was rhinestone whips and midgets
Quasimodo was jerking in hard
I seen a tribe of pygmies doing their thing
Riding in on Saint-Bernards

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me
Whew!

There was Shetland ponies and bulldogs
Jockstraps and cowboy boots
Forty-seven miles of tennis shoe tongue
And thirteen pair of shoes

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me

Let it roll!

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll one time for me
When it gets too kinky for the rest of the world
It's getting just right for me

I had me a wearied dream, seen me a wearied scene

Bracing myself for that tough spot
Just when I'm sure about what I got
No time to be wasted on the back stroke
I'm looking back on all the things that you broke
So far, so good, so what for?
It's slacking up, but you might not cut it
So far, so good, so what for?
It's growing up, you just can't slow it down
And that's a sure thing
Use what you learned to get up and face another day
Taking your time to get your feet wet
Sometimes you gotta jump in or you'll never see, never
Win
You want to go,
You move to slow
Saving up for nothing that you show or never know

So far, so good, so what for?
It's slacking up, but you might not cut it
So far, so good, so what for?
It's growing up, you just can't slow it down
And I don't know what's in store
But it's so good, so far
And that's a sure thing
And that's a sure thing
Take your time, 'cause you wanna make it
Turn up right in everyway
Make a choice if you're gonna make it
Not for nothing,
You've just gotta reach out your hand
And it's there
You've just gotta reach out your hand

In this state of grace
I'm sick and tired of falling
I want to do the right thin
But it always ends up such a mess
It's just another mix-up your expectations met
You stake your claim to failure
Then that's just what you'll be
Just what you get and so

What do you want to make of?
What do you have to work with?
A second guess is worthless
You get just one chance to go around don't you?
In this state of grace
In this state of trust
In what's in store for me

Putting on an act that just isn't working
You stole from your friends when you thought they weren't looking
Your whole fucking life, you put on a front
You pushed it to the point when my trust slips through your hands
Trust
You don't understand
Trust
Slips through your hands
Oh thought you were the one
It's what you haven't got

Try to play it cool
Why be something that you're not?
It's just the fucking point that you steal, that you miss
You pushed it to the point when my trust slips through your hands
Trust
You don't understand
Trust
Slips through your hands
Trust
Slips through your hands

What you think you don't say out loud
You're too busy following the crowd
Critisized for the things you said
You can't lead if your being lead
I won't drown
Gang opinion, it keeps you down
You can't believe it
The friends you found they'll chew you up and spit you right the fuck out
I can't imagine just what you think
Choke on approval, you don't even drink
Keep walking into the same old walls
Have a nice trip,
I'll see you next fall
I won't drown
Gang opinion, it keeps you down

I can't believe it
The friends you found
Like at a dead end street, and you're along for the ride
Where will it end?
You can't see the brick wall
You don't know, but you're headed for it
And is it easy to go through the pressure that weighs you down so far
And you know it
And when you look back and you see all the chances that you missed
Will you regret it?
It's on your shoulders now
You've gotta bear it,
Or will you fold?
That your opinion doesn't count for shit

There was a time when I washed out with the tide that came in your opinion
I second guessed what I knew was right
It was just to please and so I did it as a friend
In need of friends, what I'm looking for

'Cause it won't cut it anymore
Take a seat and watch
It counts too much
It's your decision, so what are you gonna do?

I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice
And I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice

The trouble when you go with the flow, you might set yourself up to give
Out more than you can
A situation that'll come your way,
Something you don't approve, but you couldn't see

And you're right if you're feeling bad
Lose yourself following a fad
So stick around with who you found will listen to what you gotta say
And is it easy?

I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice
And I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice

And everyone's not looking for approval
Sometimes you gotta go it alone
Don't work too hard being normal
Just work hard on what you want

So I don't need you to make my choices
I don't need you to make my choices
I don't need you to make my choices!
Make my choices

I don't need you to make my choices!

We can see the problems
But what'd you do to solve them
Talking without action
What's the difference
Something to believe in
Following your lead
It's time to pick a side not sit on a fence
It won't cut it

You wanna talk about the kids united
Take a swing at the upper hand
You wanna talk about the kids united
And this world it won't just listen

What's the situation
An un-united nation
Working for a slave wage
What would you pay?
Kicking down a closed door
Something you could fight for
It's time to pull up your head off the floor
We're standing up
You can't keep us down
We'll stick tight
You can't push us around
There's no limit to what we can do
We're gonna take it
To a level where they've got to tell the truth

It's gonna take our strength to lift it
This weight can't hold us down
Our pack solid and bonded
Open minded pushing forward
Making changes, our own choices

Try to make this scene your home
But you just can't seem to leave the kids alone
Beat down for standing up to you
It's coming back around
I'm telling the truth

Go home!
This is not your soundtrack for violence

Violence

Some people might look up to you
Maybe they have a fucking problem too
This time I'll forget my fear
It's not your song and we're making it clear

Go home!
This is not your soundtrack for violence

Sold up the river while you were asleep
A bored little watching MTV
Your days in the sun got no end in sight
It's all family fun?
Another family fight it's your

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive for the remote control
We don't care
It's a boring summer
Taking a dive we don't care
We 'll change this
People in the window watching people like you
Both looking for nothing
And you haven't got a clue
There's a world outside, join it sometime
Think you're stepping out
But you're standing in line

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive we don't care
You can't change this
Don't come to the door it's like you aren't around
Can't hear a knock over the TV sound get down
Stationary in an easy chair
Your summer is over and the trees are bare
Kiss it goodbye?your days in the sun
Comfort in the country
'Cause you're not the only one

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive for the remote control
We don't care
It's a boring summer
It's a boring summer

Boring summer
Boring summer
Boring summer
Boring summer

In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night

Stock in my seat can't move no way the other guys knows the game to play
I'm watchin' her
I'm watchin' me
I'm gettin' brave

Oh
Take him apart say listen to me.
Look on the floor and all is spinning round

Someone told me this was just a dance

And take a chance ain't met before
Do you think I really have a chance?
Hypnotic tango
Tango
Tango!

Rough diamond he smiles
She looks at him

Ain't gonna be
No story in love

Take me to the dance
Floor by the hand

Give me this night
In a foreign land.
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Hypnotic
Hypnotic

Hypnotic
Hypnotic
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is sinning round

Now won't you listen honey, while I say,
How could you tell me that you're goin' away?
Don't say that we must part,
Don't break your baby's heart

You know I've loved you for these many years,
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears?
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.

Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too.
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear,
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.

Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street

You were changin' colours like the leaves in fall
I was savin' up for the long winter
Summers wind, hideout in my car
When it broke down we didn't care
We'd figure out another way to get me there

Mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours

A realistic love runs out of room
I try to talk big but my mouth don't move
Cuz I don't own the sun I don't own the moon
They only come out when they want to
They don't care whether I promised you
They only come out when they want to
They don't care whether I promised

What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours

You wanna fight about it
You wanna fight about it
You wanna fight about it
Come on, Come on
I made you cry about it
I made you cry about it
I made you cry about it
Come on, Come on
There was no other way
To let you in here to stay
We had to give it away
Come on, Come on
And when we come up for air
And when we come up now we know

All my stones become your pearls
All of my trials are your treasures

All my dead you inherit
All of my?crimson? lines will shine

Cuz Mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours is yours is yours is yours

Stock in my seat can't move no way the other guys knows the game to play

Oh
Take him apart say listen to me.
Look on the floor and all is spinning round

Someone told me this was just a dance

And take a chance ain't met before
Do you think I really have a chance?
Hypnotic tango
Tango

Rough diamond he smiles
She looks at him

Ain't gonna be
No story in love

Take me to the dance
Floor by the hand

In a foreign land.
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Hypnotic
Hypnotic

Hypnotic
Hypnotic
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is sinning round

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say "Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch?"
The moment I could see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the "Goodbye"
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now

Mine love is mine
Whether it rain or storm or shine
Mine you are mine
Never another valentine

And I am yours tell me that I'm yours
Show me that smile my heart adores
Mine more than divine
To know that love like yours is mine

Mine, love is mine
Whether it rain or storm or shine
Mine, you are mine
Never another valentine

And I am yours tell me that I'm yours
Show me that smile my heart adores
Mine, more than divine
To know that love like yours is mine

Mine is a heart
That beats for only you
Mine is a love that always will be true
For ever more, beyond the end of time
I will be your love, promise you'll be mine

Mine is a heart
That beats for only you
Mine is a love that always will be true
For ever more, beyond the end of time
I will be your love, promise you'll be mine

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet
But when the boats have gone
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
If you fancy we can buy an ice cream cone
Your mate has gone she didn't want to be alone
I will pounce on you, just us and the cuckoos
You are helpless now
Over and over we flatten the clover
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass
Grass, (on) grass
Things we did on grass

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet
But when the boats have gone
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
If you fancy we can buy an ice-cream cone
Your mate has gone
She didn't want to be alone
I will pounce on you
Just us and the cuckoos
You are helpless now
Over and over we flatten the clover
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass
Grass, grass.
Things we did on grass

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet
But when the boats have gone
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
If you fancy we can buy an ice-cream cone
Your mate has gone
She didn't want to be alone
I will pounce on you
Just us and the cuckoos
You are helpless now
Over and over we flatten the clover
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass
Grass, grass.
Things we did on grass

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room in the colourful way

And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

The leaves of grass will not pass on
Though the millstones grind them into dust
For the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

And the brave must fall to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

If people could look into each other's eyes
What a wonderful place this world would be
All strife would end, we could start again
And dreams like these must not pass on

But the brave keep falling to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

And the brave keep falling to honor the names
Of the ones who have gone before
And the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

The leaves of grass will not pass on
Though the millstones grind them into dust
For the earth shall give new life to them
But only the grass will grow once more

I'm not in this town to stay
Said a lady old and grey
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your clothes
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

I will pawn you my watch
I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

When those gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed kissed her baby boy and then she died
Yes, warden, in the arms of her dear boy there she died
Yes, warden, in the arms of her dear boy there she died






As silver tears they weave and lace,
Sad patterns upon her face,
She waits for you.
So low below a laser sun,

Through velvet fields she runs,
Reaching for you.
And so you bleed now,
Your hand holds the knife

That is tearing your life apart.
Why don't you leave now,
The city's too heavy
And your dreams they melt in the sun.

On mellow blue, birds curve and glide.
Through shadows of grief she slides,
She waits for you.
There on a hill before the dawn,

In silence a promise torn,
She turns from you.
And so you bleed now ...
As silver tears, they weave and lace,

She waits for you.
So low below a laser sun,
Reaching for you.
On mellow blue birds curve and glide.

She waits for you.
There on a hill before the dawn,
She turns from you...

Groovy day,
A sunny day,
Walking through the country.

Just a breeze,
And I feel at ease,
Walkin' through the country.

Blades of grass,
Playin' with my feet,
And there's nothing so sweet,
As the way you treat me.

Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country!

Singing!

Ohhh, feelin' good, Baby

I know there's someone,
Someone who needs you.
Walkin' through the country together,
And love's gonna,
Come to you.

Oh, what a groovy, groovy day,
A sunny day.
Walkin' through the country.

Just a breeze,
And I feel at ease,
Walkin' through the country.

Blades of grass,
Playin' with my feet,
There's nothing so sweet,
As the way you treat me.

Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country,
You're walkin' through the country!

Singing!

Keep walkin' through the country, baby.
Feels good now, doesn't it?
Walkin' through the country

Glory Bound
Grass Roots

All the sun on the outside
Doesn't touch what I feel within
When I've got you beside me
I'm reachin' out for the rainbow's end
You get to me and give me a feelin' that's comin' on
Gettin' stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
Glory bound to that everlastin' feelin'
Glory bound, oh I'm never never comin' down

I'm lookin' out on a sky of gray
I don't care, let the rains come
If I'm with you it's a sunny day
You make me feel so close to heaven
Whenever I'm beside you

[Chorus]

I need the comfort I see in your smile
I need the touch of your hand
Come on and bring out the best in me, girl
Don't you know that you can

[Erick Sermon]
And you don't quit
Yeah  pioneers one time (one time  two times)
Yeah  Erick Sermon boy

[Parrish Smith]
Yeah  we rap  where you at? (mic check)
"Check this out!"
Hey yo who want to step up and get their cranium cracked
From my man Louis from the Ville Slugger baseball bat
Cock back gats, cause rugged apparel's where it's at

So stand back, we flash a nine before the jack and squeeze triggers
Blazin' at one hit wonder niggas like Smoothe Da Hustler
I still sneak over and fuck your babysitter
No quitter, microphone's my transmitter
Which clocks figures, in return, the track's the Gold Digger

[Erick Sermon]
Huh me? I buy ice for no one
Rap shogun, so I bought myself a gun
Yeah Dunn, ain't the one to be steppin' to son
I agree with Slick Rick, you cats is crumbs
My squad gets Dumb and Jim Carrey you ought the buildin'
Messin' around with God's children
I take action, like film crews
You against me, face to face, you'll lose!

Here comes two big pioneers, Rolex watches
Cars by the pairs, in stock we got shares
"That's right!"
Legendary, hardcore be-boy is the pedigree

[Erick Sermon]
P and I don't stop, we don't quit, who's seein' em?
On tracks, we Ruff Ryde like D and them
Then case the joint, like an agent, that's secret
Cats hate, so we on point frequent
E keep it decent, had to smack a dude recent
Right down the block, from the precinct
See you a punk, that talk too lenient
When I speak to a motherfucker, I MEAN IT!

[Parrish Smith]
So Open Sesame, and let down the main gate
But before you scream EPMD, you should wait
Cause we roll with a posse, from Strong Long to Canarsie
QBC, Boogie Down Bronx, back to Marcy
Pass that kiko, I drop a verse that sound slick yo
And your chick know, P's hungry, like the hippos
Suck on no nipples, but duck cats, quick to stick you
Like a pin-up, workin' out, and doin' chin-ups

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
Huh, hey yo my style flows, say it liquidates
It's best when it hits the beat and catch the breaks
Two time felon, fuck aroud with me
And my man pussycat and catch two to the melon!

[Parrish Smith]
Then I be like, "Yep yep," just like Teddy, Raw like Eddie
Sweaty, when I hold shit down and bake like Betty
And when I want things to move, I blink like Bewitched
To handle shit in the dark, red lights, with the laser hit

[Chorus]

Oh Pioneer, I sing your song
Well it's the hymn of those who've gone before and those who carry on
Pioneer, your work is hard
But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart

Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Oh Pioneer
So young and brave
Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
Pioneer, you orphaned child
Your mother is adventure and your father is the wild

Where are we going, oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

I won't run when bullets chase me
I won't rest where arms embrace me
I will love when people hate me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
Send the dark but it won't break me
You can try but you can't change me
Take my life, they will replace me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
I won't hush, no we will sing
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

Oh Pioneer, I sing your song
Well it's the hymn of those who've gone before and those who carry on
Pioneer, your work is hard
But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart

Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Oh Pioneer
So young and brave
Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
Pioneer, you orphaned child
Your mother is adventure and your father is the wild

Where are we going, oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

I won't run when bullets chase me
I won't rest where arms embrace me
I will love when people hate me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
Send the dark but it won't break me
You can try but you can't change me
Take my life, they will replace me
I won't hush, no you can't make me
I won't hush, no we will sing
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer

Let your heart not be troubled

When I was a young boy
I wanted to sail around the world
That's the life for me, living on the sea
Spirit of a sailor, circumnavigates the globe
The lust of a pioneer, will acknowledge no frontier
I remember you by, thunderclap in the sky
Lightning flash, tempers flare,
'round the horn if you dare
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Lucky just to keep afloat

Aotearoa, rugged individual
Glisten like a pearl, at the bottom of the world
The tyranny of distance, didn't stop the cavalier
So why should it stop me, I'll conquer and stay free
Ah c'mon all you lads, let's forget and forgive
There's a world to explore, tales to tell back on shore
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Six months in a leaky boat

Ship-wrecked love can be cruel
Don't be fooled by her kind
There's a wind in my sails
Will protect and prevail
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Nothing to it leaky boat.

Reachin' for a space in time, layin' our fate on the line
Starting out a life anew, after we've come so far
Won't you look and see now, here we are

You were the ones, there is no doubt
You ate it up and spit it out
You were the ones, you made it clear, you could take it
We are the sons of the pioneers (we are the sons of pioneers)
The day has come, our fate is clear
We're the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
We're not afraid to try (we're not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear

What's the point of going on, if you feel that it couldn't be done
Cause I just wanna understand, freedom's the soul of a man
Won't you look and see now, and show me how

We have the chance, there is no doubt
We'll pick it up, and see it out
We are the ones, you made it clear, we can take it
We are the sons of the pioneers (we are the sons of pioneers)
The day has come, the way is clear
For the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear......................fear

When you think of how far we've come, and to know that we've only begun
Leaving us a legacy, makes sense to me
That now our time has come, for we have to move on

You were the ones, there is no doubt
You ate it up and spit it out
You were the ones, you made it clear, you could take it
And now it's time, our fate is surely here now
There is no doubt about it, it's time we thought about it
We are the ones, the way is clear, for the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afriad of fear

Is there any doubt, none at all, they heard the call of the
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear

Control
If it can be broke then it can be fixed, if it can be fused then it can be split
It's all under control
If it can be lost then it can be won, if it can be touched then it can be turned
All you need is time

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

A sense of purpose and a sense of skill, a sense of function but a disregard
We will not be the first, we won't
You said you were going to conquer new frontiers,
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world, we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

Breath in, breath out

If it can be broke then it can be fixed, if it can be fused then it can be split
It's all under control
If it can be lost then it can be won, if it can be touched then it can be turned
All you need is time

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

A sense of purpose and a sense of skill, a sense of function but a disregard
We will not be the first, we won't
You said you were going to conquer new frontiers,
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world, we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

Breath in, breath out

So here we are reinventing the wheel
I'm shaking hands with a hurricane
It's a colour that I can't describe,
It's a language I can't understand
Ambition, tearing out the heart of you
Carving lines into you
Dripping down the sides of you

We will not be the last.

If it can be broke then it can be fixed, if it can be fused then it
Can be split
It's all under control
If it can be lost then it can be won, if it can be touched then it
Can be turned
All you need is time

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?


A sense of purpose and a sense of skill, a sense of function
But a disregard
We will not be the first, we won't
You said you were going to conquer new frontiers,
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world we'd tame it, what were we hoping for?

Breath in, breath out

So here we are reinventing the wheel
I'm shaking hands with a hurricane
It's a color that I can't describe,
It's a language I can't understand
Ambition, tearing out the heart of you
Carving lines into you
Dripping down the sides of you

We will not be the last.

Dismiss the telegram
This is no exhibition
A pile of papers that are bound and tethered
We know the end of man will stem
From stale tradition
Relaying opinions
Changing like the weather

And this will never be and this will never be reversed
An installation
Sending an open invitation
To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone and
We keep wishing for a new frontier
Out of their teeth and bones
Forget what you thought you believed in

The plans we execute are far between and few
But I'll go around the world just for something to do
Existence is fleeting
You spend your life dreaming
The shores are exhausted
The time is receding

And this will never be a
And this will never be reversed
An installation
Sending an open invitation
To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone
And we keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in
And forget what you thought you believed in

And those who resisted
Were dragged out form there homes
This necklace was fashioned from their teeth and bones
And those who resisted
Were dragged out from their homes
This necklace was fashioned from their teeth and bones
Their teeth and bones

To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone and
We keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in
And forget what we you thought you believed in

Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting

Here where we stand there used to be a forest
A timber rising endlessly before us
We cleared away that God forsaken jungle
And in return the Indians adore us

What was mud now is a highway
Reaching wide into a prairie
Horses run cattle are grazing
You would swear it was Oklahoma

Day by day dark is illuminated
God's mistake altered and uncreated
Wrong's made right left to the jungle pioneer

See in the field my little son and daughter
Not long ago that ground was underwater
Now you can see them walking with the cattle
Singing them songs before they go to slaughter

There are those who would appose us
Crying out, "God save the planet"
Bleeding hearts can't turn assunder
This the eighth and final wonder

Day by day this land is liberated
God's mistake altered and uncreated
Wrong's made right left to the jungle pioneer

Saddle up giddy up and ride on out of here
We got a mile of burning to do today
Get along now gonna need you out of here
We got a pile of earning to do today

Down in Brazil there used to be a forest
Now in it's place a crazy wind is whistling
As every tree was falling in the forest
It made a sound but nobody was listening

When the last is buried under
What has been will be no longer
No matter what man may endeavor
Eden's gate closes forever

Day by day life is eliminated
God's own work altered and eliminated
Through it all there stands the jungle pioneer

It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember,
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, "Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that
Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, "Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."





You keep telling me yes
But you don't mean it
You keep telling me no
And try to lean it
You're giving me buts and maybe
You know this will drive me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no

You wear a plastic smile
I know by you eyes
You speak with indefinite style
You're telling me lies
You've got to face reality
What is wrong with you and me
Why can't you free your honesty

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no

Yes I know, know your love is gone
And you feel, you can't carry on
The burden gets heavier
And your sorrows are deeper, girl

You've got to give a little, take a little
Pay the price, make a sacrifice
Give a little, take a little
True love's a game if you give and take

Remember Romeo and Juliet
How they gave and took a lot, don't you forget
I know it's so hard to believe
But be smart and you won't have to fear

You've got to give a little, take a little
Pay the price, make a sacrifice
Give a little, take a little
True love's a game if you give and take

Yes, you'll say you haven't lost your faith
You'll get tired of this long wait
You must give if you want to get
If you do that you know you won't regret

The requested track is not viewable.

This could be asking for more than I merit
This could be testing your patience
I really don't have a whole lot to draw from
But I'd be willing to learn, only

Don't expect much style & finesse
But don't be surprised if I impress
I say this even though I'm almost sure by now you know

I say this even though I'm almost sure by now you know

Well way out west where the wild wind blows the eagle flies and the sage brush grows
Traditions are holding on you'll be glad to hear
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
Like that young cowboy from old Montana got boots and spurs and a black bandana
He rides the wild prairie rounding up the steers
Just like his Daddy he's a son of The Pioneers
From Texas clear up the Idaho from the mountains to the plains
They got the blood of Crockett and Geronimo flowing through their veins
Now the wild old west is changing some but traditions persevere
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
[ piano - fiddle ]
There's a gal down in Texas with a great big hat
She likes roping and dancing and things like that
And if you need a hand at your branding she'll volunteer
She's a wild prairie flower and a daughter of the Pioneers
He's got braids and hat with an eagle feather
He rides with broncs there ain't none better
And his great grandaddy was a chief on the wild frontier
And he's a proud son of the original Pioneers
Well from Texas clear up the Idaho...
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers

Enter the Wu-Tang zone

We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella

Enter the Wu-Tang zone

I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, 4 plus 4, but 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs

Pioneer the frontier

Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?

You enterin' the 36, masterin' the 18
[?] chamber sixth, hands down, I crush bricks
Backs that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal strikin' attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shallow steppin' ninja

Pioneer the frontier

What a weepin' and wailin' dung a Caymanas park
What a weepin' and wailin' dung a Caymanas park
Long Shot, him kick de bucket
Long Shot kick de bucket

Get up, get up in the first race
And them pull up the pace
Get up, get up in the first race
And them pull up the pace
And Long Shot, him kick de bucket
Long Shot kick de bucket

Them wail, them wail, them reel
But they couldn't take the trail
Them wail, them wail, them reel
But they couldn't take the trail
And Long Shot, him kick de bucket
Long Shot kick de bucket

It was Starbright, Combat, Corazon
Long Shot on the rear
It was Starbright, Combat, Corazon
Long Shot on the rear
Combat fell, Long Shot fell
All we money gone a hell
All we money gone a hell
And Long Shot, him kick de bucket

Start with colors
They always get away with attitude
But they'll try to convince you of your mood
And what you want they'll give it to you
But it's only therapy, that's all they do

And for a year she was anti-pioneer
Singing sappy songs
About what went wrong

Two years before, but even now
When the false is true
When I call me you

When the flag changes colors
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go
When the flag changes colors

The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go

Anti-pioneer then
Anti-pioneer then
Anti-pioneer then
Anti-pioneer then

And for a year she was anti-pioneer

They passed her off too late
To change her future's fate
But even now when the false gets true
And living colors seem possible to you

When the flag changes colors
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go

When the flag changes colors
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go home

Sometimes I feel I've been here forever
Sometime ago
Sometimes we sense the doubt together
Sometimes alone

I'm tired but we won't sleep at all
Even though the air is calm
There's something here it's something warm
Something cuts and scars inside tonight

Sons of pioneers are hungry men

Every voice I hear sounds so familiar
Every song I know
Still there's been no change in the weather
But sometime we'll have to go

I'm tired but we won't sleep at all
Even though the air is calm
There's something here it's something warm
Something cuts and scars inside tonight

Sons of pioneers are hungry men

What a weepin' and wailin' dung a Caymanas park
What a weepin' and wailin' dung a Caymanas park

And them pull up the pace
Get up, get up in the first race

Them wail, them wail, them reel
